Influenza Laboratory The viruses are 80120 nanometres in diameter 1 Specialty Infectious disease  Swine influenza is an infection caused by any one of several types of swine influenza  viruses  Swine influenza virus  SIV  or swineorigin influenza virus  SOIV  is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs  2 As of 2009 the known SIV strains include influenza C and the subtypes of influenza A known as H1N1  H1N2  H2N1 H3N1  H3N2  and H2N3  The Swine flu was initially seen in humans in Mexico in 2009 where the strain of the particular virus was a mixture from 3 types of strains 3 Six of the genes are very similar to the H1N2 influenza virus that was found in pigs around 2000 3  Swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human flu  often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood If transmission does cause human flu it is called zoonotic swine flu People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection Around the mid20th century identification of influenza subtypes became possible allowing accurate diagnosis of transmission to humans Since then only 50 such transmissions have been confirmed These strains of swine flu rarely pass from human to human Symptoms of zoonotic swine flu in humans are similar to those of influenza and of influenzalike illness in general namely chills  fever  sore throat  muscle pains  severe headache  coughing  weakness  shortness of breath and general discomfort  In August 2010 the World Health Organization declared the swine flu pandemic officially over 4 5  Cases of swine flu have been reported in India  with over 31156 positive test cases and 1841 deaths up to March 2015 6   Contents   1  Signs and symptoms   11  Humans    2  Virology   21  Transmission   211  Between pigs  212  To humans  213  Interaction with avian H5N1 in pigs    22  Structure   221

produces fever  lethargy  sneezing  coughing  difficulty breathing and decreased appetite 7 In some cases the infection can cause miscarriage  Although mortality is usually low around 14 2 the virus can produce weight loss and poor growth  causing economic loss to farmers 7 Infected pigs can lose up to 12 pounds of body weight over a three to fourweek period 7 Swine have receptors to which both avian and mammalian influenza viruses are able to bind to which leads to the virus being able to evolve and mutate into different forms 8 Influenza A is responsible for infecting swine and was first identified in the summer of 1918 8 Pigs have often been seen as mixing vessels which help to change and evolve strains of disease that are then passed on to other mammals such as humans 8   Humans  edit    Main symptoms of swine flu in humans 9  Direct transmission of a swine flu virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible  zoonotic swine flu  citation needed  In all 50 cases are known to have occurred since the first report in medical literature in 1958 which have resulted in a total of six deaths 10 Of these six people one was pregnant one had leukemia  one had Hodgkins lymphoma and two were known to be previously healthy One of these had unknown whereabouts 10 Despite these apparently low numbers of infections the true rate of infection may be higher since most cases only cause a very mild disease and will probably never be reported or diagnosed 10   Play media  In this video Dr Joe Bresee with CDCs Influenza Division describes the symptoms of swine flu and warning signs to look for that indicate the need for urgent medical attention See also See this video with subtitles on YouTube 11  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC in humans the symptoms of the 2009 swine flu H1N1 virus are similar to those of influenza and of influenzalike illness in general Symptoms include fever  cough  sore throat  watery eyes body aches shortness of breath headache  weight loss chills  sneezing runny nose coughing dizziness abdominal pain lack of appetite and fatigue  The 2009 outbreak has shown an increased percentage of patients reporting diarrhea and vomiting as well The 2009 H1N1 virus is not zoonotic swine flu as it is not transmitted from pigs to humans but from person to person through airborne droplets  citation needed   Because these symptoms are not specific to swine flu a differential diagnosis of probable swine flu requires not only symptoms but also a high likelihood of swine flu due to the persons recent and past medical history For example during the 2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States  the CDC advised physicians to consider swine influenza infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute febrile respiratory illness who have either been in contact with persons with confirmed swine flu or who were in one of the five US states that have reported swine flu cases or in Mexico during the seven days preceding their illness onset 12 A diagnosis of confirmed swine flu requires laboratory testing of a respiratory sample a simple nose and throat swab 12  The most common cause of death is respiratory failure  Other causes of death are pneumonia leading to sepsis  13 high fever leading to neurological problems dehydration from excessive vomiting and diarrhea  electrolyte imbalance and kidney failure  14 Fatalities are more likely in young children and the elderly  Virology  edit   Transmission  edit   Between pigs  edit   Influenza is quite common in pigs with about half of breeding pigs having been exposed to the virus in the US 15 Antibodies to the virus are also common in pigs in other countries 15  The main route of transmission is through direct contact between infected and uninfected animals 7 These close contacts are particularly common during animal transport Intensive farming may also increase the risk of transmission as the pigs are raised in very close proximity to each other 16 17 The direct transfer of the virus probably occurs either by pigs touching noses or through dried mucus Airborne transmission through the aerosols produced by pigs coughing or sneezing are also an important means of infection 7 The virus usually spreads quickly through a herd infecting all the pigs within just a few days 2 Transmission may also occur through wild animals such as wild boar  which can spread the disease between farms 18   To humans  edit   People who work with poultry and swine especially those with intense exposures are at increased risk of zoonotic infection with influenza virus endemic in these animals and constitute a population of human hosts in which zoonosis and reassortment can cooccur 19 Vaccination of these workers against influenza and surveillance for new influenza strains among this population may therefore be an important public health measure 20 Transmission of influenza from swine to humans who work with swine was documented in a small surveillance study performed in 2004 at the University of Iowa 21 This study among others forms the basis of a recommendation that people whose jobs involve handling poultry and swine be the focus of increased public health surveillance 19 Other professions at particular risk of infection are veterinarians and meat processing workers although the risk of infection for both of these groups is lower than that of farm workers 22   Interaction with avian H5N1 in pigs  edit   Pigs are unusual as they can be infected with influenza strains that usually infect three different species pigs birds and humans 23 This makes pigs a host where influenza viruses might exchange genes producing new and dangerous strains 23 Avian influenza virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains 24  H3N2 evolved from H2N2 by antigenic shift  25 In August 2004 researchers in China found H5N1 in pigs 26  These H5N1 infections may be quite common in a survey of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in West Java  where avian flu had broken out five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus The Indonesian government has since found similar results in the same region Additional tests of 150 pigs outside the area were negative 27 28   Structure  edit    Structure of H1N1 Virion   Main symptoms of swine flu in swine 2  The influenza virion is 
roughly spherical It is an enveloped virus the outer layer is a lipid membrane which is taken from the host cell in which the virus multiplies Inserted into the lipid membrane are spikes which are proteinsactually glycoproteins because they consist of protein linked to sugarsknown as HA  hemagglutinin  and NA  neuraminidase  These are the proteins that determine the subtype of influenza virus AH1N1 for example  The HA and NA are important in the immune response against the virus antibodies proteins made to combat infection against these spikes may protect against infection The NA protein is the target of the antiviral drugs Relenza and Tamiflu  Also embedded in the lipid membrane is the M2 protein  which is the target of the antiviral  adamantanes  amantadine and rimantadine   Classification  edit   Of the three genera of influenza viruses that cause human flu  two also cause influenza in pigs with influenza A being common in pigs and influenza C being rare 29  Influenza B has not been reported in pigs Within influenza A and influenza C the strains found in pigs and humans are largely distinct although because of reassortment there have been transfers of genes among strains crossing swine avian and human species boundaries  Influenza C  edit   Influenza  viruses infect both humans and pigs but do not infect birds 30 Transmission between pigs and humans have occurred in the past 31 For example influenza C caused small outbreaks of a mild form of influenza amongst children in Japan 32 and California 32 Because of its limited host range and the lack of genetic diversity in influenza C this form of influenza does not cause pandemics in humans 33   Influenza A  edit   Swine influenza is caused by influenza A subtypes H1N1  34  H1N2  34  H2N3  35  H3N1  36 and H3N2  34 In pigs four influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 H1N2 H3N2 and H7N9 are the most common strains worldwide 7 In the United States  the H1N1 subtype was exclusively prevalent among swine populations before 1998 however since late August 1998 H3N2 subtypes have been isolated from pigs As of 2004 H3N2 virus isolates in US swine and turkey stocks were triple reassortants  containing genes from human HA NA and PB1 swine NS NP and M and avian PB2 and PA lineages 37 In August 2012 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 145 human cases 113 in Indiana 30 in Ohio one in Hawaii and one in Illinois of H3N2v since July 2012 38 The death of a 61yearold Madison County Ohio woman is the first in the nation associated with a new swine flu strain She contracted the illness after having contact with hogs at the Ross County Fair 39   Diagnosis  edit    Thermal scanning of passengers arriving at Singapore Changi airport  The CDC recommends realtime PCR as the method of choice for diagnosing H1N1 40 The oral or nasal fluid collection and RNA virus preserving filter paper card is commercially available 41 This method allows a specific diagnosis of novel influenza H1N1 as opposed to seasonal influenza  Nearpatient pointofcare tests are in development 42   Prevention  edit   Prevention of swine influenza has three components prevention in pigs prevention of transmission to humans and prevention of its spread among humans You can prevent it from spreading by washing your hands often for about as long as you can sing the happy birthday song twice avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth Stay away from someone who has symptoms of the cold or flu and also avoid contact with others  Swine  edit   Methods of preventing the spread of influenza among swine include facility management herd management and vaccination  ATCvet code QI09AA03  WHO  Because much of the illness and death associated with swine flu involves secondary infection by other pathogens control strategies that rely on vaccination may be insufficient Control of swine influenza by vaccination has become more difficult in recent decades as the evolution of the virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the infection when the virus strains match enough to have significant crossprotection and custom autogenous vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases 43 44 Present vaccination strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined only 41 isolates had strong serologic crossreactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses 10 45 The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick it does not block infection or shedding of the virus 46  Facility management includes using disinfectants and ambient temperature to control viruses in the environment They are unlikely to survive outside living cells for more than two weeks except in cold but above freezing conditions and are readily inactivated by disinfectants 2 Herd management includes not adding pigs carrying influenza to herds that have not been exposed to the virus The virus survives in healthy carrier pigs for up to three months and can be recovered from them between outbreaks Carrier pigs are usually responsible for the introduction of SIV into previously uninfected herds and countries so new animals should be quarantined  15 After an outbreak as immunity in exposed pigs wanes new outbreaks of the same strain can occur 2   Humans  edit   Prevention of pigtohuman transmission   Swine can be infected by both avian and human flu strains of influenza and therefore are hosts where the antigenic shifts can occur that create new influenza strains The transmission from swine to humans is believed to occur mainly in swine farms where farmers are in close contact with live pigs Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans this may occasionally happen so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face masks when dealing with infected animals The use of vaccines on swine to prevent their infection is a major method of limiting swinetohuman transmission Risk factors that may contribute to swinetohuman transmission include smoking and especially not wearing gloves when working with sick animals thereby increasing the likelihood of subsequent handtoeye handtonose or handtomouth transmission 47   Prevention of humantohuman transmission  Influenza spreads between humans when infected people cough or sneeze then other people breathe in the virus or touch something with the virus on it and then touch their own face 48 Avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth Germs spread this way 49 Swine flu cannot be spread by pork products since the virus is not transmitted through food 48 The swine flu in humans is most contagious during the first five days of the illness although some people most commonly children can remain contagious for up to ten days Diagnosis can be made by sending a specimen collected during the first five days for analysis 50    Thermal imaging camera and screen photographed in an airport terminal in Greece  thermal imaging can detect elevated body temperature one of the signs of the virus H1N1 swine influenza  Recommendations to prevent spread of the virus among humans include using standard infection control  which includes frequent washing of hands with soap and water or with alcoholbased hand sanitizers  especially after being out in public 51 Chance of transmission is also reduced by disinfecting household surfaces which can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach solution 52  Experts agree handwashing can help prevent viral infections including ordinary and the swine flu infections Also avoiding touching ones eyes nose or mouth with ones hands helps to prevent the flu 49 Influenza can spread in coughs or sneezes but an increasing body of evidence shows small droplets containing the virus can linger on tabletops telephones and other surfaces and be transferred via the fingers to the eyes nose or mouth Alcoholbased gel or foam hand sanitizers work well to destroy viruses and bacteria Anyone with flulike symptoms such as a sudden fever cough or muscle aches should stay away from work or public transportation and should contact a doctor for advice 53  Social distancing  another tactic is staying away from other people who might be infected and can include avoiding large gatherings spreading out a little at work or perhaps staying home and lying low if an infection is spreading in a community Public health and other responsible authorities have action plans which may request or require social distancing actions depending on the severity of the outbreak  Vaccination  edit   Main article 2009 flu pandemic vaccine  Vaccines are available for different kinds of swine flu The US Food and Drug Administration FDA approved the new swine flu vaccine for use in the United States on September 15 2009 54 Studies by the National Institutes of Health show a single dose creates enough antibodies to protect against the virus within about 10 days 55  In the aftermath of the 2009 pandemic several studies were conducted to see who received influenza vaccines  These studies show that whites are much more likely to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza and for the H1N1 strain than African Americans 56 This could be due to several factors  Historically there has been mistrust of vaccines and of the medical community from African Americans  Many African Americans do not believe vaccines or doctors to be effective  This mistrust stems from the exploitation of the African American communities during studies like the Tuskegee study   Additionally vaccines are typically administered in clinics hospitals or doctors offices  Many people of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive vaccinations because they do not have health insurance  Surveillance  edit   Although there is no  formal national surveillance system in the United States to determine what viruses are circulating in pigs 57 an informal surveillance network in the United States is part of a world surveillance network 58   Treatment  edit   Swine  edit   As swine influenza is rarely fatal to pigs little treatment beyond rest and supportive care is required 15 Instead veterinary efforts are focused on preventing the spread of the virus throughout the farm or to other farms 7 Vaccination and animal management techniques are most important in these efforts Antibiotics are also used to treat this disease which although they have no effect against the influenza virus do help prevent bacterial pneumonia and other secondary infections in influenzaweakened herds 15  In Europe the avianlike H1N1 and the humanlike H3N2 and H1N2 are the most common influenza subtypes in swine of which avianlike H1N1 is the most frequent Since 2009 another subtype pdmH1N12009 emerged globally and also in European pig population The prevalence varies from country to country but all of the subtypes are continuously circulating in swine herds 
In the EU region wholevirus vaccines are available which are inactivated and adjuvanted Vaccination of sows is common practice and reveals also a benefit to young pigs by prolonging the maternally level of antibodies Several commercial vaccines are available including a trivalent one being used in sow vaccination and a vaccine against pdmH1N12009 In vaccinated sows multiplication of viruses and virus shedding are significantly reduced  Humans  edit   If a person becomes sick with swine flu antiviral drugs can make the illness milder and make the patient feel better faster They may also prevent serious flu complications For treatment antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick within two days of symptoms Beside antivirals supportive care at home or in a hospital focuses on controlling fevers relieving pain and maintaining fluid balance as well as identifying and treating any secondary infections or other medical problems The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of oseltamivir Tamiflu or zanamivir Relenza for the treatment andor prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses however the majority of people infected with the virus make a full recovery without requiring medical attention or antiviral drugs 59 The virus isolated in the 2009 outbreak have been found resistant to amantadine and rimantadine  60  In the US on April 27 2009 the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations to make available Relenza and Tamiflu  antiviral drugs to treat the swine influenza virus in cases for which they are currently unapproved The agency issued these EUAs to allow treatment of patients younger than the current approval allows and to allow the widespread distribution of the drugs including by  volunteers 61   History  edit   Swine influenza was first proposed to be a disease related to human flu during the 1918 flu pandemic  when pigs became ill at the same time as humans 62 The first identification of an influenza virus as a cause of disease in pigs occurred about ten years later in 1930 63 For the following 60 years swine influenza strains were almost exclusively H1N1 Then between 1997 and 2002 new strains of three different subtypes and five different genotypes emerged as causes of influenza among pigs in North America In 19971998 H3N2 strains emerged These strains which include genes derived by reassortment from human swine and avian viruses have become a major cause of swine influenza in North America Reassortment between H1N1 and H3N2 produced H1N2  In 1999 in Canada a strain of H4N6 crossed the species barrier from birds to pigs but was contained on a single farm 63  The H1N1 form of swine flu is one of the descendants of the strain that caused the 1918 flu pandemic  64 65 As well as persisting in pigs the descendants of the 1918 virus have also circulated in humans through the 20th century contributing to the normal seasonal epidemics of influenza 65 However direct transmission from pigs to humans is rare with only 12 recorded cases in the US since 2005 66 Nevertheless the retention of influenza strains in pigs after these strains have disappeared from the human population might make pigs a reservoir where influenza viruses could persist later emerging to reinfect humans once human immunity to these strains has waned 67  Swine flu has been reported numerous times as a zoonosis in humans usually with limited distribution rarely with a widespread distribution Outbreaks in swine are common and cause significant economic losses in industry primarily by causing stunting and extended time to market For example this disease costs the British meat industry about 65 million every year 68   1918 pandemic  edit   The 1918 flu pandemic in humans was associated with H1N1 and influenza appearing in pigs 65 this may reflect a zoonosis either from swine to humans or from humans to swine Although it is not certain in which direction the virus was transferred some evidence suggests in this case pigs caught the disease from humans 62 For instance swine influenza was only noted as a new disease of pigs in 1918 after the first large outbreaks of influenza amongst people 62 Although a recent phylogenetic analysis of more recent strains of influenza in humans birds animals and many others and swine suggests the 1918 outbreak in humans followed a reassortment event within a mammal 69 the exact origin of the 1918 strain remains elusive 70 It is estimated that anywhere from 50 to 100 million people were killed worldwide 65 71   1976 US outbreak  edit   Main article 1976 swine flu outbreak  On February 5 1976 a United States army recruit at Fort Dix said he felt tired and weak He died the next day and four of his fellow soldiers were later hospitalized Two weeks after his death health officials announced the cause of death was a new strain of swine flu The strain a variant of H1N1 is known as ANew Jersey1976 H1N1 It was detected only from January 19 to February 9 and did not spread beyond Fort Dix 72    US President Gerald Ford receives a swine flu vaccination  This new strain appeared to be closely related to the strain involved in the 1918 flu pandemic Moreover the ensuing increased surveillance uncovered another strain in circulation in the US AVictoria75 H3N2  which spread simultaneously also caused illness and persisted until March 72 Alarmed public health officials decided action must be taken to head off another major pandemic and urged President Gerald Ford that every person in the US be vaccinated for the disease 73  The vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems 74 On October 1 1976 immunizations began and three senior citizens died soon after receiving their injections This resulted in a media outcry that linked these deaths to the immunizations despite the lack of any proof the vaccine was the cause According to science writer Patrick Di Justo however by the time the truth was knownthat the deaths were not proven to be related to the vaccineit was too late The government had long feared mass panic about swine flunow they feared mass panic about the swine flu vaccinations This became a strong setback to the program 75  There were reports of GuillainBarr  syndrome GBS a paralyzing neuromuscular disorder affecting some people who had received swine flu immunizations Although whether a link exists is still not clear this syndrome may be a side effect of influenza vaccines As a result Di Justo writes the public refused to trust a governmentoperated health program that killed old people and crippled young people In total 48161019 Americans or just over 22 of the population had been immunized by the time the National Influenza Immunization Program was effectively halted on December 16 1976 76  77  Overall there were 1098 cases of GBS recorded nationwide by CDC surveillance 532 of which occurred after vaccination and 543 before vaccination 78 About one to two cases per 100000 people of GBS occur every year whether or not people have been vaccinated 79 The vaccination program seems to have increased this normal risk of developing GBS by about to one extra case per 100000 vaccinations 79  Recompensation charges were filed for over 4000 cases of severe vaccination damage including 25 deaths totalling US35 billion by 1979 80 The CDC stated most studies on modern influenza vaccines have seen no link with GBS 79 81 82 Although one review gives an incidence of about one case per million vaccinations 83 a large study in China reported in the New England Journal of Medicine  covering close to 100 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine found only 11 cases of GBS which is lower than the normal rate of the disease in China The riskbenefit ratio which is what vaccines and everything in medicine is about is overwhelmingly in favor of vaccination 84   1988 US outbreak  edit   In September 1988 a swine flu virus killed one woman and infected others A 32yearold woman  Barbara Ann Wieners was eight months pregnant when she and her husband Ed became ill after visiting the hog barn at a county fair in Walworth County Wisconsin  Barbara died eight days later after developing pneumonia 85 The only pathogen identified was an H1N1 strain of swine influenza virus 86 Doctors were able to induce labor and deliver a healthy daughter before she died Her husband recovered from his symptoms Influenzalike illness ILI was reportedly widespread among the pigs exhibited at the fair Of the 25 swine exhibitors aged 9 to 19 at the fair 19 tested positive for antibodies to SIV but no serious illnesses were seen The virus was able to spread between people since one to three health care personnel who had cared for the pregnant woman developed mild influenzalike illnesses and antibody tests suggested they had been infected with swine flu but there was no community outbreak 87 88  In 1998 swine flu was found in pigs in four US states Within a year it had spread through pig populations across the United States Scientists found this virus had originated in pigs as a recombinant form of flu strains from birds and humans This outbreak confirmed that pigs can serve as a crucible where novel influenza viruses emerge as a result of the reassortment of genes from different strains 89 90 2 Genetic components of these 1998 triplehybrid stains would later form six out of the eight viral gene segments in the 2009 flu outbreak 91 92 93 94 95   2007 Philippine outbreak  edit   On August 20 2007 Department of Agriculture officers investigated the outbreak of swine flu in Nueva Ecija and central Luzon  Philippines The mortality rate is less than 10 for swine flu unless there are complications like hog cholera  On July 27 2007 the Philippine National Meat Inspection Service NMIS raised a hog cholera red alert warning over Metro Manila and five regions of Luzon after the disease spread to backyard pig farms in Bulacan and Pampanga  even if these tested negative for the swine flu virus 96 97   2009 Northern Ireland outbreak  edit   Since November 2009 14 deaths as a result of swine flu in Northern Ireland have been reported The majority of the victims were reported to have preexisting health conditions which had lowered their immunity This closely corresponds to the 19 patients who had died in the year prior due to swine flu where 18 of the 19 were determined to have lowered immune systems Because of this many mothers who have just given birth are strongly encouraged to get a flu shot because their immune systems are vulnerable Also studies have shown that people between the ages of 15 and 44 have the highest rate of infection Although most people now recover having any conditions that lower ones immune system increases the risk of having the flu become potentially lethal In Northern Ireland now approximately 56 of all people under 65 who are entitled to the vaccine have gotten the shot and the outbreak is said to be under control 98   2015 and 2017 India outbreaks  edit   Swine flu outbreaks were reported in India in late 2014 and early 2015 As of March 19 2015 the disease has affected 31151 people and claimed over 1841 lives 6 99 The largest number of reported cases and deaths due to the disease occurred in the western part of India including states like Delhi  Madhya Pradesh  Rajasthan  and Gujarat 
Researchers of MIT have claimed that the swine flu has mutated in India to a more virulent version with changes in Hemagglutinin protein This has however been disputed by Indian researchers 100  There was another outbreak in India in 2017 The states of Maharashtra and Gujarat were the worst affected 101 Gujarat high court has given Gujarat government instructions to control deaths by swine flu 102 Actor Aamir Khan and wife Kiran Rao were among the latest to be afflicted by swine flu 103 The couple spoke about their battle with the H1N1 virus via video conference at the Satyamev Jayate Water Cup event in Pune  which they had to skip due to illhealth More than 1094 people died of Swine flu in India in year 2017 till 26 August 2017 104   2015 Nepal outbreak  edit   Swine flu outbreaks were reported in Nepal in the spring of 2015 As of April 21 2015 the disease has claimed 26 lives in the most severely affected district Jajarkot in Northwest Nepal 105 Cases were also detected in the districts of Kathmandu  Morang  Kaski  and Chitwan  106 As of 22 April 2015 the Nepal Ministry of Health reported that  2498 people had been treated in Jajarkot of whom 552 were believed to have swine flu and acknowledged that the governments response had been inadequate 107 The Jajarkot outbreak had just been declared an emergency when the April 2015 Nepal earthquake struck on 25 April 2015 diverting all medical and emergency resources to quakerelated rescue and recovery  2016 Pakistan outbreak  edit   Seven cases of swine flu were reported in Punjab province of Pakistan  mainly in the city of Multan  in January 2017 Cases of swine flu were also reported in Lahore and Faisalabad  108   2017 Maldives outbreak  edit   As of 16 March 2017 over a hundred confirmed cases of swine flu and at least six deaths were reported in the Maldivian capital of Mal  and some other islands Makeshift flu clinics were opened in Male 109 Schools universities and colleges in the capital were closed prison visitations suspended several events cancelled and all nonessential travel to other islands outside the capital was advised against by the HPA An influenza vaccination program focused on pregnant women was initiated soon after 110 An official visit by the Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud to the Maldives during his Asian tour was also cancelled last minute amidst fears over the outbreak of swine flu  H1N1 virus pandemic history  edit   A study conducted in 2008 and published in the journal Nature  has managed to establish the evolutionary origin of the flu strain of swine origin SOIV 111  The phylogenetic origin of the flu virus that caused the 2009 pandemics can be traced before 1918 Around 1918 the ancestral virus of avian origin crossed the species boundaries and infected humans as human H1N1 The same phenomenon took place soon after in America where the human virus was infecting pigs it led to the emergence of the H1N1 swine strain which later became the classic  clarification needed  swine flu However genetic coding of H1N1 shows it is a combination of segments of 4 influenza viruses forming a novel strain

Due to coinfection the viruses are able to interact mutate and form a new strain to which host has variable immunity New events of reassortment were not reported until 1968 when the avian strain H1N1 infected humans again this time the virus met the strain H2N2 and the reassortment originated the strain H3N2 This strain has remained as a stable flu strain until now The mid1970s were important for the evolution of flu strains First the reemergence of the human H1N1 strain became a seasonal strain Then a small outbreak of swine H1N1 occurred in humans and finally the human H2N2 strain apparently became extinct Around 1979 the avian H1N1 strain infected pigs and gave rise to Euroasiatic swine flu and H1N1 Euroasiatic swine virus which is still being transmitted in swine populations The critical moment for the 2009 outbreak was between 1990 and 1993 A triple reassortment event in a pig host of North American H1N1 swine virus the human H3N2 virus and avian H1N1 virus generated the swine H1N2 strain
Finally the last step in SOIV history was in 2009 when the virus H1N2 coinfected a human host at the same time as the Euroasiatic H1N1 swine strain This led to the emergence of a new human H1N1 strain which caused the 2009 pandemic On June 11 2009 the World Health Organization raised the worldwide pandemic alert level to Phase 6 for swine flu which is the highest alert level 112 This alert level means that the swine flu had spread worldwide and there were cases of people with the virus in most countries  The pandemic level identifies the spread of the disease or virus and not necessarily the severity of the disease Swine flu spread very rapidly worldwide due to its high humantohuman transmission rate and due to the frequency of air travel 112  In 2015 the instances of swine flu substantially increased to five year highs with over 10000 cases reported and 660 deaths in India 113 The states reporting the highest number of cases and deaths are Rajasthan Gujarat Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra Delhi and  Telangana 114 The circulating strain of influenza being the same unmutant strain that caused global pandemic in 2009 A H1N1 pdm 09 the sudden spurt of the cases in the beginning of 2015 left the Indian government unexplained but concerned Government instructed the affected states to investigate into the epidemiological reasons of such spurt in the states and had detailed the advisory guidelines to all states The guidelines are mainly for a description of A H1N1 for prompt identification detection and distinction from the symptoms of other similar infection such as common flucold b categorization of screening of influenza A H1N1 cases c clinical management protocol of Pandemic influenza A H1N1 d providing home care e collection of human sample 115 Besides through the National Centre for Diseases Control NCDC Directorate General of Health Services DGHS Government of India GoI had placed a tender to procure 8 kits of Assay sets 37 kits of one step RTPCR kit and 36 kits of viral RNA extraction kits 116   Notes  edit       International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses The Universal Virus Database version 4 Influenza A  Archived from the original on January 13

Cough Ask WebMD       Is the H1N1 Swine Flu Vaccine Safe  H1N1 Swine Flu Vaccine Safety Hype Myths and Facts   By Daniel J DeNoon       From the WebMD Archives     What do we really know about the 2009 H1N1 swine flu  vaccine  What do we really not know  Questions about the safety of the vaccine persist Surf the Internet or flip through TV stations and youll encounter a multitude of myths and a whole lot of hype  What are the facts Straightforward answers follow these questions    Is the 2009 H1N1 swine flu vaccine safe    Isnt the 2009 H1N1 swine flu vaccine too new to trust    Why should I believe what government scientists say about swine flu    Does the H1N1 swine flu vaccine contain thimerosal    The 1976 swine flu vaccine wasnt safe Why should I trust this one    Do we really know what drugmakers are putting in the swine flu vaccine       Is the 2009 H1N1 swine flu vaccine safe  No vaccine is 100 safe for everyone People with allergies to eggs for example cant take flu vaccines because eggs are involved in the manufacturing process  And flu vaccines cause mild but common reactions About one in three people get a sore arm from the shot some with a little redness or even swelling Some 10 to 15 of people feel tired or get a headache  some may even run a low fever   And vaccines can trigger rare but serious reactions even among people with no apparent allergies or sensitivities  So if vaccines arent 100 safe why risk them  Approved vaccines  including the 2009 H1N1 swine flu vaccine  are calculated to be much much less risky than the diseases they prevent For example out of every million people who get a flu shot one or two will get a serious neurological reaction called Guillain Barre syndrome  GBS   But flu itself causes serious problems including GBS in far more than two in a million cases And since a large proportion of the population will get swine flu the vaccine risk is far smaller than the disease risk  In clinical trials  10000 to 15000 children and adults have received various manufacturers brands of H1N1 swine flu vaccine Nothing serious happened to any of them including this reporter who received a double dose of the SanofiPasteur swine flu vaccine     Continued   Thats still not proof that no harm will come from the vaccine Clinical trials cannot detect something bad that happens to one or two out of every 100000 people vaccinated  There could be unknown side effects Something could happen But we think that is highly unlikely says infectious disease and vaccine expert Mark Mulligan MD executive director of the Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta  The CDC FDA HHS Health and Human Services Department the Department of Defense and several large HMOs with great medical records are all collaborating in enhanced surveillance for this national 2009 H1N1 vaccine campaign Mulligan tells WebMD If there is a signal for a rare or late adverse event we will identify it as early and as quickly as we can    Isnt the 2009 H1N1 swine flu vaccine too new to trust  Is the swine flu vaccine brand new Yes and no The 2009 H1N1 swine flu vaccine is made exactly the same way as the seasonal flu vaccine by the same manufacturers using the same materials  except for one shiny new piece  What has changed is the piece of the virus the vaccine uses to prime the immune system  Vaccine experts tell WebMD this change isnt all that new Every couple of years or so a new variant of a seasonal flu virus comes along When that happens a new vaccine is made using the relevant part of the variant virus  And even though the 2009 H1N1 swine flu is a genuinely new virus its still closely related to seasonal flu bugs One of the vaccines in the threeinone seasonal flu vaccine protects against seasonal H1N1 flu which is about 75 similar to the 2009 H1N1 swine flu  although it offers no protection against the pandemic flu  Last year some 100 million people got the seasonal flu vaccine No safety issues appeared Thats reassuring but its no proof that something rare and unexpected cant happen  Theres no denying that the virus particle used in the vaccine has never been used before No scientific calculation can rule out the chance that something unexpected might happen  But one can calculate that this chance will be small And the chance that the vaccine will prevent serious illness and deaths is very very large     Continued   Why should I believe what government scientists say about swine flu  The public health agenda is to promote healthy practices  such as eating wholesome foods and quitting smoking  that not everyone likes Why Science suggests that these policies save lives and cut health care costs  The public health agenda also promotes vaccination against disease  even though the rare individual is harmed by a vaccine Why Science suggests such a policy saves lives and cuts health care costs as long as disease risks outweigh vaccination risks A good example is the smallpox vaccine which eradicated one of the scourges of mankind even though a number of people were harmed by the vaccine  After weighing the benefits vs the risks the health agencies of the US government have launched the most massive vaccination campaign in history to fight the 2009 H1N1 swine flu The CDC is using simple direct messages  including advertising and press conferences  to encourage people to get the vaccine  In public health you have to have campaigns and try to talk people into things Mulligan tells WebMD The question about the government is a very important one But things have changed since the old days of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment Now we have very strict regulation of government research People can trust and believe that this is not politicians talking but researchers presenting evidencebased recommendations    Does the H1N1 swine flu vaccine contain thimerosal  The 2009 H1N1 swine flu vaccine comes in three basic types the FluMist nasal spray singlesyringe shots and multishot vials  Only the multishot vials contain thimerosal a preservative that prevents bacterial contamination of the vial Before thimerosal was added to vaccines there were occasional vaccine injuries due to contamination  Extensive study shows that there are no more adverse events in children or adults who receive thimerosalcontaining vaccines than in those who do not  But thimerosal contains a form of mercury Its ethyl mercury which is likely not as toxic as some other forms Even so nobody argues that mercury is good for your body People who want to avoid thimerosalcontaining flu vaccines must get the FluMist vaccine or the singlesyringe shots  Most people should have this choice But singlesyringe vaccines may not be available for every person in every location during every week of the vaccination campaign     Continued   The 1976 swine flu vaccine wasnt safe Why should I trust this one  The 1976 swine flu vaccine was linked to safety issues Neal Halsey MD director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health was at the CDC in those days  We did identify an increased risk of GBS GuillainBarre syndrome in the six weeks following immunization Halsey tells WebMD What is not known at this time is exactly why that vaccine was associated with that increased risk  No flu vaccine since then has been linked to this risk Halsey thinks there is the potential for the H1N1 flu vaccine to carry a risk of causing one case of GBS per million people vaccinated  The theoretical risk of that rare complication has to be balanced against the severity of the H1N1 flu he says There already have been a lot of deaths many in otherwise healthy normal children There is always a real risk from the flu and a theoretical risk from the vaccines  In 1976 the risk from flu was theoretical too Despite a scary and fatal outbreak of an H1N1 swine flu at a military base the virus never spread  The 1976 H1N1 swine flu was a very different virus from the 2009 H1N1 swine flu which combines elements from flu viruses that evolved in birds humans and pigs And unlike the 1976 virus the 2009 bug is causing a very real pandemic    Do we really know what drugmakers are putting in the swine flu vaccine  Vaccine labels are not easy to read But they are made public by the FDA and other sources If you want to know exactly whats in each kind of 2009 H1N1 swine flu vaccine read the label You can find all the labels here httpwwwvaccinesafetyedupackageinsertshtm      WebMD Feature  Reviewed by Louise  Chang MD

be wondering if you have contracted the H1N1 swine flu virus The reality is 
that it isnt possible to know unless specialized testing is ordered and for 
uncomplicated cases of the flu in nonhospitalized patients routine testing for 
the H1N1 virus is not being carried out    Learn when to seek medical care for H1N1 swine flu symptoms           What is the swine flu  Swine flu swine influenza is a respiratory disease caused by viruses influenza viruses that infect the respiratory tract of pigs resulting in nasal secretions a barking cough decreased appetite and listless behavior Swine flu produces most of the same symptoms in pigs as human flu produces in people Swine flu can last about one to two weeks in pigs that survive Swine influenza virus was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in the US and has been recognized by pork producers and veterinarians to cause infections in pigs worldwide In a number of instances people have developed the swine flu infection when they are closely associated with pigs for example farmers pork processors and likewise pig populations have occasionally been infected with the human flu infection In most instances the crossspecies infections swineorigin virus to man human flu virus to pigs have remained in local areas and have not caused national or worldwide infections in either pigs or humans Unfortunately this crossspecies situation with influenza viruses human infections with swine viruses has had the potential to change Investigators decided the 2009 socalled swine flu strain first seen in Mexico should be termed novel H1N1 flu since it was mainly found infecting people and exhibits two main surface antigens H1 hemagglutinin type 1 and N1 neuraminidase type1 The eight RNA strands from novel H1N1 flu have one strand derived from human flu strains two from avian bird strains and five from swine strains The main swine flu viruses in pigs in the recent years are swine triple reassortant tr it means a viral strain with genes from three different organisms H1N1 trH3N2 and trH1N2 However in August 2018 China first reported a new swine flu outbreak in pigs in Liaoning province The pig flu strain known as African swine flu although some researchers think it originated in Russia almost 100 fatal to pigs was the cause This strain is highly infectious survives in heat and cold environments and can remain viable and infectious on surfaces for days to weeks Currently there is no effective vaccine or drug to stop its spread so the disease is treated by immediate slaughter of infected pigs China has about 50 of the worlds pig population and relies on pork to provide a large amount of protein for the Chinese population Culling the pig population in China may result in China needing to import pork that would likely be a large economic blow to Chinas economy This virus has not yet been detected in the US This flu strain reportedly does not spread to humans        Natural Cold  Flu Remedies Slideshow        Anatomy of a Sore Throat Slideshow        Flu Slideshow 10 Foods to Eat When You Have the Flu        How is swine flu transmitted Is swine flu contagious  Swine influenza is transmitted from person to person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets containing virus from people sneezing or coughing  it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork products The newest swine flu virus that has caused swine flu is influenza A H3N2v commonly termed H3N2v that began as an outbreak in 2011 The v in the name means the virus is a variant that normally infects only pigs but has begun to infect humans There have been small outbreaks of H1N1 influenza since the pandemic a recent one is in India where at least three people have died What is the incubation period for swine flu  The incubation period for swine flu is about one to four days with the average being two days in some people the incubation period may be as long as about seven days in adults and children    Quick Guide Common Respiratory Illnesses           What is the contagious period for swine flu  The contagious period humantohuman viral infection for swine influenza in adults usually begins one day before symptoms develop in an adult and it lasts about five to seven days after the person becomes sick However people with weakened immune systems and children may be contagious for a longer period of time for example about 10 to 14 days How long does the swine flu last  In uncomplicated infections swine flu typically begins to resolve after three to seven days but the malaise and cough can persist two weeks or more in some patients Severe swine flu may require hospitalization that increases the length of time of infection to about nine to 10 days What causes swine flu  The cause of the 2009 swine flu was an influenza A virus type designated as H1N1 In 2011 a new swine flu virus was detected The new strain was named influenza A H3N2v Only a few people mainly children were first infected but officials from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC reported increased numbers of people infected in the 20122013 flu season Currently there are not large numbers of people infected with H3N2v Unfortunately another virus termed H3N2 note no v in its name has been detected and caused flu but this strain is different from H3N2v In general all of the influenza A viruses have a structure similar to the H1N1 virus each type has a somewhat different H andor N structure        Natural Cold  Flu Remedies Slideshow        Anatomy of a Sore Throat Slideshow        Flu Slideshow 10 Foods to Eat When You Have the Flu       Why is swine flu now infecting humans  Many researchers now consider that two main series of events can lead to swine flu and also avian or bird flu  becoming a major cause for influenza illness in humans First the influenza viruses types A B C are enveloped RNA viruses with a segmented genome this means the viral RNA genetic code is not a single strand of RNA but exists as eight different RNA segments in the influenza viruses A human or bird influenza virus can infect a pig respiratory cell at the same time as a swine influenza virus some of the replicating RNA strands from the human virus can get mistakenly enclosed inside the enveloped swine influenza virus For example one cell could contain eight swine flu and eight human flu RNA segments The total number of RNA types in one cell would be 16 four swine and four human flu RNA segments could be incorporated into one particle making a viable eight RNAsegmented flu virus from the 16 available segment types Various combinations of RNA segments can result in a new subtype of virus this process is known as antigenic shift that may have the ability to preferentially infect humans but still show characteristics unique to the swine influenza virus see Figure 1 It is even possible to include RNA strands from birds swine and human influenza viruses into one virus if a single cell becomes infected with all three types of influenza for example two bird flu three swine flu and three human flu RNA segments to produce a viable eightsegment new type of flu viral genome Formation of a new viral type is considered to be antigenic shift small changes within an individual RNA segment in flu viruses are termed antigenic drift see figure 1 and result in minor changes in the virus However these small genetic changes can accumulate over time to produce enough minor changes that cumulatively alter the virus makeup over time usually years Second pigs can play a unique role as an intermediary host to new flu types because pig respiratory cells can be infected directly with bird human and other mammalian flu viruses Consequently pig respiratory cells are able to be infected with many types of flu and can function as a mixing pot for flu RNA segments see figure 1 Bird flu viruses which usually infect the gastrointestinal cells of many bird species are shed in bird feces Pigs can pick these viruses up from the environment and this seems to be the major way that bird flu virus RNA segments enter the mammalian flu virus population Figure 1 shows this process in H1N1 but the figure represents the genetic process for all flu viruses including human swine and avian strains like H1N2 bird flu Figure 1    Daily Health News   Education Level and Alzheimers  Ebola at Philadelphia Hospital  New Antibiotic

are swine flu symptoms and signs       Readers Comments 7      Share Your Story     Symptoms of swine flu are similar to most influenza infections fever 100 F or greater cough usually dry nasal secretions fatigue  and headache  with fatigue being reported in most infected individuals Some patients may also get a sore throat  rash  body muscle aches or pains headaches  chills  nausea  vomiting  and diarrhea  In Mexico many of the initial patients infected with H1N1 influenza were young adults which made some investigators speculate that a strong immune response as seen in young people may cause some collateral tissue damage The incubation period from exposure to first symptoms is about one to four days with an average of two days The symptoms last about one to two weeks and can last longer if the person has a severe infection Some patients develop severe respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath  and need respiratory support such as a ventilator to breathe for the patient Patients can get pneumonia bacterial secondary infection if the viral infection persists and some can develop seizures  Death often occurs from secondary bacterial infection of the lungs  appropriate antibiotics need to be used in these patients The usual mortality death rate for typical influenza A is about 01 while the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic had an estimated mortality rate ranging from 220 Swine H1N1 flu in Mexico had about 160 deaths and about 2500 confirmed cases which would correspond to a mortality rate of about 6 but these initial data were revised and the mortality rate worldwide was estimated to be much lower Fortunately the mortality rate of H1N1 remained low and similar to that of the conventional flu average conventional flu mortality rate is about 36000 per year projected H1N1 flu mortality rate was 90000 per year in the US as determined by the presidents advisory committee but it never approached that high number Fortunately although H1N1 developed into a pandemic worldwide flu strain the mortality rate in the US and many other countries only approximated the usual numbers of flu deaths worldwide Speculation about why the mortality rate remained much lower than predicted includes increased public awareness and action that produced an increase in hygiene especially hand washing a fairly rapid development of a new vaccine and patient selfisolation if symptoms developed        Natural Cold  Flu Remedies Slideshow        Anatomy of a Sore Throat Slideshow        Flu Slideshow 10 Foods to Eat When You Have the Flu        What types of health care professionals treat swine flu  Almost all uncomplicated patients with swine flu can be treated at home or by the patients pediatrician primary care provider or emergencymedicine doctor For more complicated andor severe swine flu infections specialists such as critical care specialists lung specialists pulmonologists and infectiousdisease specialists may be consulted What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose swine flu  Swine flu is presumptively diagnosed clinically by the patients history of association with people known to have the disease and their symptoms listed above Usually a quick test for example nasopharyngeal swab sample is done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A or B virus Most of the tests can distinguish between A and B types The test can be negative no flu infection or positive for type A and B If the test is positive for type B the flu is not likely to be swine flu If it is positive for type A the person could have a conventional flu strain or swine flu However the accuracy of these tests has been challenged and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC has not completed their comparative studies of these tests However a new test developed by the CDC and a commercial company reportedly can detect H1N1 reliably in about one hour the test was formerly only available to the military In 2010 the FDA approved a commercially available test that could detect H1N1 within four hours Most of these rapid tests are based on PCR technology Swine flu is definitively diagnosed by identifying the particular antigens surface proteins associated with the virus type In general this test is done in a specialized laboratory and is not done by many doctors offices or hospital laboratories However doctors offices are able to send specimens to specialized laboratories if necessary Because of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that occurred in the 20092010 flu season the vast majority of flu cases about 9599 were due to novel H1N1 flu viruses the CDC recommended only hospitalized patients flu virus strains be sent to reference labs to be identified H3N2v flu strains and other flu virus strains are diagnosed by similar methods   What is the treatment for swine flu       Readers Comments 2      Share Your Story     The best treatment for influenza infections in humans is prevention by vaccination Work by several laboratories has produced vaccines  The first H1N1 vaccine released in early October 2009 was a nasal spray vaccine that was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 249 However the use of nasal spray has not been recommended since 2016 The injectable vaccine made from killed H1N1 became available in the second week of Oct 2009 This vaccine was approved for use in ages 6 months to the elderly including pregnant females The CDC approved both of these vaccines only after they had conducted clinical trials to prove that the vaccines were safe and effective Almost all vaccines have some side effects Common side effects of H1N1 vaccines alone or in combination with other flu viral strains are typical of flu vaccines used over many years and are as follows Flu shot  Soreness redness minor swelling at the shot site muscle aches lowgrade fever and nausea do not usually last more than about 24 hours Nasal spray runny nose  lowgrade fever vomiting  headache  wheezing  cough and sore throat Intradermal shot redness swelling pain  headache  muscle aches fatigue The flu shot vaccine is made from killed virus particles so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot However the nasal spray vaccine contains live virus that have been altered to hinder its ability to replicate in human tissue People with a suppressed immune system should not get vaccinated with the nasal spray Also most vaccines that contain flu viral particles are cultivated in eggs so individuals with an allergy to eggs were cautioned about getting the vaccine unless tested and advised by their doctor that they are cleared to get it  However more refined vaccine preparations have contained very few egg allergens so the egg allergy factor of vaccines has been almost eliminated Like all vaccines rare events may occur in some rare cases for example swelling weakness  or shortness of breath About one person in 1 million who gets the vaccine may develop a neurological problem termed GuillainBarr  syndrome which can cause weakness or paralysis  difficulty breathing  bladder andor bowel problems and other nerve problems If any symptoms like these develop see a physician immediately Several antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu The most used are zanamivir Relenza and oseltamivir Tamiflu both of which are also used to prevent or reduce influenza A and B symptoms These drugs should not be used indiscriminately because viral resistance to them can and has occurred Also they are not recommended if the flu symptoms already have been present for 48 hours or more although hospitalized patients may still be treated past the 48hour guideline The CDC has suggested in their guidelines that pregnant females can be treated with the two antiviral agents Severe infections in some patients may require additional supportive measures such as ventilation support and treatment of other infections like pneumonia that can occur in patients with a severe flu infection Two other new antiviral drugs Rapivab and Xofluza may also be used under certain conditions Some researchers suggest the data on Tamiflu and Relenza is not correct and suggest the antivirals are not effective On Dec 22 2014 the FDA approved the first new antiinfluenza drug for H1N1 and other influenza virus types in 15 years peramivir injection Rapivab It is approved for use in the following settings Diarrhea  skin infections hallucinations  andor altered behavior may occur as side effects of this drug Adult patients for whom therapy with an intravenous IV medication is clinically appropriate based upon one or more of the following reasons The patient is not responding to either oral or inhaled antiviral therapy or drug delivery by a route other than IV is not expected to be dependable or is not feasible or the physician decides that IV therapy is appropriate due to other circumstances Pediatric patients for whom an intravenous medication clinically appropriate because The patient is not responding to either oral or inhaled antiviral therapy or drug delivery by a route other than IV is not expected to be dependable or is not feasible Another new drug baloxavir marboxil Xofluza is an oral antiviral approved in 2018 for use in children 12 years and older   Subscribe to MedicineNets General Health Newsletter By clicking Submit I

an outbreak of swine flu at Fort Dix This virus was not the same as the 2009 H1N1 outbreak but it was similar insofar as it was an influenza A virus that had similarities to the swine flu virus There was one death at Fort Dix The government decided to produce a vaccine against this virus but the vaccine was associated with rare instances of neurological complications GuillainBarr  syndrome and was discontinued Some individuals speculate that formalin used to inactivate the virus may have played a role in the development of this complication in 1976 One of the reasons it takes a few months to develop a new vaccine is to test the vaccine for safety to avoid the complications seen in the 1976 vaccine Individuals with active infections or diseases of the nervous system are also not recommended to get flu vaccines Early in the spring of 2009 H1N1 flu virus was first detected in Mexico causing some deaths among a younger population It began increasing during the summer 2009 and rapidly circulated to the US and to Europe and eventually worldwide The WHO declared it first fit their criteria for an epidemic and then in June 2009 the WHO declared the first flu pandemic in 41 years There was a worldwide concern and people began to improve in hand washing and other prevention methods while they awaited vaccine development The trivalent vaccine made for the 20092010 flu season offered virtually no protection from H1N1 New vaccines were developed both live and killed virus and started to become available in Sept 2009Oct 2009 The CDC established a protocol guideline for those who should get the vaccine first By late December to January a vaccine against H1N1 was available in moderate supply worldwide The numbers of infected patients began to recede and the pandemic ended However a strain of H1N1 was incorporated into the yearly trivalent vaccine for the 20102011 flu season because the virus was present in the world populations As stated in the first section of this article a new strain of swine flu H3N2v was detected in 2011 it has not affected any large numbers of people in the current flu season However another antigenically distinct virus with the same H and N components termed H3N2 note no v has caused flu in humans viral antigens were incorporated into the 20132014 seasonal flu shots and nasal spray vaccines In India in 20152016 a large outbreak of swine flu killed more than 1900 people During 2016 the numbers of infected people and deaths due to swine flu dropped but now in 2017 there is a marked resurgence of the disease The new outbreak of swine flu that began in January 2017 has resulted in 22 186 people being diagnosed with the infection There have been 1094recorded deaths in 8 months and the spread of the infection shows no signs of slowing In the first three weeks of August 2017 342 deaths were due to swine flu Unfortunately private hospitals and clinics do not have to report the number of swine flu diagnoses or deaths so it is possible according to one medical director of a private clinic that the current statistics represent possibly just the tip of the iceberg In the US the 20172018 flu season was termed a high severity season by the CDC because an estimated 80000 people died of flu and its complications   What 
are the risk factors for swine flu       Readers Comments 33      Share Your Story     Vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for people who are at increased risk for severe complications from influenza or at higher risk for influenzarelated doctor or hospital visits When vaccine supply is limited vaccination efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to the following people since these populations have a higher risk for H1N1 and some other viral infections according to the CDC All children 6 months to 4 years 59 months of age All people 50 years of age and older Adults and children who have chronic pulmonary including asthma  or cardiovascular except isolated hypertension  renal hepatic neurological hematologic or metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus  People who have immunosuppression including immunosuppression caused by medications or by HIV  Women who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season Children and adolescents 6 months to 18 years of age who are receiving longterm aspirin therapy and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection Residents of nursing homes and other longterm care facilities American IndiansAlaska natives People who are morbidly obese  BMI 40 Health care professionals doctors nurses health care personnel treating patients Household contacts and caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 50 years of age and older with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children less than 6 months age Household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza   Is it possible to prevent swine flu with a vaccine  The CDC recommends for the 20182019 flu season that everyone 6 months old and older should get a flu shot to prevent or reduce the chance of getting the flu The best way to prevent novel H1N1 swine flu is vaccination The CDC recommendations that apply to H1N1 H3N2 and other flu viruses are almost identical to those abovementioned recommendations for patients at risk when vaccine doses are limited and are as follows Are aged 6 months through 4 years 59 months Are aged 50 years and older Have chronic pulmonary including asthma  cardiovascular except hypertension  renal hepatic neurologic hematologic or metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus Are immunosuppressed including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus  Are or will be pregnant during the influenza season Are aged 6 months through 18 years and receiving longterm aspirin therapy and who therefore might be at risk for experiencing Reyes syndrome after influenza virus infection Are residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities Are American IndiansAlaska Natives Are morbidly obese bodymass index is 40 or greater Are health care personnel Are household contacts and caregivers of children aged younger than 5 years and adults aged 50 years and older with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children aged younger than 6 months Are household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza As in previous recommendations all children aged 6 months to 8 years of age who receive a seasonal influenza vaccine for the first time should receive two doses Children who received only one dose of a seasonal influenza vaccine in the first influenza season should receive two doses rather than one in the following influenza season A newly approved inactivated trivalent vaccine containing 60 mcg of hemagglutinin antigen per influenza vaccine virus strain  Fluzone HighDose Sanofi Pasteur is an alternative inactivated vaccine for people 65 years of age and older The CDC occasionally makes changes and updates its information on vaccines and other recommendations about any current flu pandemics The CDC states for the most accurate health information visit httpwwwcdcgov or call 1800CDCINFO 247 Caregivers should check the vaccine package inserts for more detailed information on the vaccines when they become available The CDC says that a good way to prevent any flu disease is to avoid exposure to the virus this is done by frequent hand washing not touching your hands to your face especially the nose and mouth and avoiding any close proximity to or touching any person who may have flu symptoms Since the virus can remain viable and infectious for about 48 hours on many surfaces good hygiene and cleaning with soap and water or alcoholbased hand disinfectants are also recommended Some physicians say face masks may help prevent getting airborne flu viruses for example from a cough or sneeze but others think the better use for masks would be on those people who have symptoms and sneeze or cough The use of Tamiflu Relenza or other antivirals may help prevent the flu if taken before symptoms develop or reduce symptoms if taken within about 48 hours after symptoms develop Some investigators say that administration of these drugs is still useful after 48 hours especially in highrisk patient populations However taking these drugs is not routinely recommended for prevention for the healthy population because investigators suggest that as occurs with most drugs flu strains will develop resistance to these medications During the H1N1 pandemic the CDC made further suggestions about the use of these antiviral medications and developed the interim guidelines for use of Tamiflu Relenza and recently updated information for new antivirals peramivir Rapivab and Xofluza as follows Patients with highrisk factors should discuss flu symptoms and when to use antiviral medications doctors should provide a prescription for the antiviral drug for the patient to use if the patient is exposed to flu or develops flulike symptoms without having to go in to see the doctor Watchful waiting was added as a response to taking antiviral medications with the emphasis on the fact that those people who develop fever and have a preexisting health condition should then begin the antiviral medication The antiviral medications are the firstline medicines for treatment of novel H1N1 H3N2 and H3N2v flu and many viruses are to date susceptible to Tamiflu Relenza Rapivab and Xofluza In general preventive measures to prevent the spread of flu are often undertaken by those people who have symptoms Symptomatic people should stay at home avoid crowds and take off from work or school until the disease is no longer transmittable about two to three weeks or until medical help and advice is sought Sneezing coughing and nasal secretions need to be kept away from other people simply using tissues and disposing of them will help others Quarantining patients is usually not warranted but such measures depend on the severity of the disease The CDC recommends that people who appear to have an influenzalike illness upon arrival at work or school or become ill during the day be promptly separated from other people and be advised to go home until at least 24 hours after they are free of fever 100 F 378 C or greater or signs of a fever without the use of feverreducing medications The novel H1N1 swine flu disease takes about seven to 10 days before fevers stop but research data suggests waiting until the cough is gone since many people are still infectious about one week after fever is gone However the CDC did not extend their recommendations to stay home for that extra week   Is it possible to prevent swine flu if the swine flu vaccine or other flu strain vaccines is not readily available  Although vaccination is the best way to prevent the swine flu there may be times in the future when the swine flu vaccine may not be available There are no shortages of the trivalent flu vaccine that contains H1N1 antigens However during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic this situation did occur so people wanted to know what they could do to protect themselves If in the future vaccine supplies do not meet demands there are some things people can do to try and prevent infection Without vaccination the best strategy is to not allow any virus type to contact a persons mucus Quarantining any virusinfected people is an extreme measure that may work in some instances for example China used this method but even with quarantining the virus may still spread by people who have minimal or no symptoms The next step that is easier to be implemented by individuals is for people with the disease to selfquarantine until they become noninfectious about seven to 10 days after flu symptoms abate Infected people can wear surgical masks to reduce the amount of droplet spray from coughs and sneezes and throw away contaminated tissues Unfortunately these approaches depend on the compliance of many other people and the likelihood that such methods will be highly successful in preventing flu virus infections at best is only fair Such methods did not stop the 2009 H1N1 pandemic although they may have some benefit for a few individuals Yet there are still some other methods available to individuals Perhaps the best way for individuals to try to prevent flu virus infection is a combination of methods that are aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle that if the virus doesnt reach an individuals mucus membrane cells infection will be prevented The methods are as follows Kill or inactivate the virus before it reaches a human cell by using soap and water to clean your hands washing clothing and taking a shower will do the same for the rest of your body Use an alcoholbased hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available and use sanitizers on objects that many people may touch for example doorknobs computer keyboards handrails phones although some researchers suggest that such sanitizers are generally ineffective Do not touch your mouth eyes nose unless you first do items 1 or 2 above Avoid crowds parties and especially people who are coughing and sneezing most viruscontaining droplets do not travel more than 4 feet  so experts suggest 6 feet away is a good distance to stay If you cannot avoid crowds or parties try to remain aware of people around you and use the 6foot rule with anyone coughing or sneezing Do not reach for or eat snacks out of canisters or other containers at parties Avoid touching anything within about 6 feet of an uncovered coughsneeze because the droplets that contain virus fall and land on anything usually within that range Studies show that individuals who wear surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation of some H1N1 virus but the masks may prevent only about 50 of airborne exposures and offer no protection against surface droplets However masks on H1N1 infected people can markedly reduce the spread of infected droplets These six steps can help prevent individuals from getting H1N1 and other types of infection but for many people adherence to them may be difficult at best However there are some additional strategies that may also help prevent viral infections in unvaccinated people according to some investigators Saline nasal washes and gargling with saline or a commercial product as a way to reduce or eliminate viral virus from mucus membranes has been suggested Proponents of these methods base their rationale on the fact that flu viruses usually take about two to three days to proliferate in nasalthroat cells While nasal washes and gargling may be soothing to some people there are no studies that indicate H1N1 or other viruses are killed inactivated or completely removed by these methods conversely there are no data suggesting these methods cannot have any effect on H1N1 However with longterm nasal washes using Neti pots sinus infection with other pathogens may be encouraged Other investigators and physicians have offered additional methods that may help reduce exposure to H1N1 virus For example Dr Gerberding a former CDC director had several suggestions about how to avoid H1N1 infection on an airplane She suggested the following If a person is next to you or near within 6 feet and is coughingsneezing ask the flight attendant to offer the person a mask If there are available seats 6 feet or more away from the coughingsneezing person ask to change your seat planes are good means of travel because the air is recirculated through HEPA filters that can capture viruses but even the filters will not help if people touch areas where droplets have landed HEPA filters are usually not available in buses cars ships or trains Turn away from the coughingsneezing person and turn the air vent toward the person to blow the droplets away from yourself Variations of her suggestions may be applicable in many different social or work or travel situations but there are no data to prove these methods are effective In addition commonsense precautions such as not drinking or eating things touched by others avoiding casual physical contacts for example handshakes social hugs or kisses public water fountains these are OK if you touch nothing and lips only touch flowing water banisters on stairways and restroom door handles will limit exposure to H1N1 and other viruses Again these commonsense suggestions lack data substantiation Many investigators suggest that people stay well hydrated take vitamins  and get plenty of rest but these precautions will not prevent H1N1 or other viral infections although they may help reduce the effects of infection by strengthening the persons immune system to fight infection Similarly current antiviral medications described in the preceding section act on H1N1 and other viruses that have already infected cells they work by preventing or reducing viral particles from aggregating and being released from infected cells Timing is important if only a few cells are infected and the antiviral medications are administered quickly usually before flu symptoms develop or within 48 hours the viruses are reduced in number they cannot easily bud out from the cell surface so few if any other respiratory or mucus membrane cells become infected This can result in either no flu symptoms or if a larger number of cells were initially infected less severe symptoms The overall effect for the person is that the H1N1 or other viral infection was prevented it was not the symptoms were prevented from developing or that symptoms were reduced In the strictest sense of the word prevention even effective vaccines do not prevent infections What they do accomplish is to alert the immune system to be on guard for certain antigens that are associated with a specific diseasecausing agent for example H1N1 virus pneumococcal bacteria When the agent first infects the host its antigens are recognized and these cause a rapid immune response to occur that prevents the pathogen from spreading and developing symptoms in the host People including physicians and researchers often term this complex response to vaccination as prevention of infection but what actually occurs is the prevention of further infection so well that symptoms do not develop or are minimal in the host In summary if H1N1 or other viruses fail to contact cells they can infect the disease will be prevented As stated above this is difficult but not impossible to do in almost all societies Prevention of flu symptoms of infection is possible with antiviral medications if these are given very early in the infection There are many other methods that may reduce the chance of getting the virus on a persons mucosal surface but most methods have not been backed up with objective data Most doctors and investigators suggest that items that help boost or allow the immune response to function well will help people resist H1N1 and other viral infections and reduce symptoms but these also do not prevent infections Consequently while waiting for a specific antiviral vaccine to be developed or become available there are some ways individuals can improve their chances of preventing or reducing the symptoms of flu virus infections All of these suggestions apply to H3N2vcaused swine flu as well Because H3N2v flu has been more closely related to pigs pig farming and county fairs people who are at higher risk see above should avoid contacting pigs in these settings   Are there home remedies for swine flu  There are many flu cures and treatments described on the Internet for example how cayenne pepper menthol or ginseng can be used to treat the flu before using any of these substances check with a doctor However there are many overthecounter medications such as naproxen  Aleve  ibuprofen  Advil and others and acetaminophen  Tylenol  to reduce fever and discomfort lozenges to sooth a sore throat  and decongestants to help manage mucus production and coughing These medications help manage flu symptoms but do not cure the viral disease   Was swine flu H1N1 a cause of an epidemic or pandemic in the 20092010 flu season  Yes An epidemic is defined as an outbreak of a contagious disease that is rapid and widespread affecting many individuals at the same time The swine flu outbreak in Mexico fit this definition A pandemic is an epidemic that becomes so widespread that it affects a region continent or the world On June 11 2009 WHO officials determined that H1N1 2009 influenza A swine flu reached WHO level 6 criteria persontoperson transmission in two separate WHOdetermined world regions and declared a swine flu pandemic the first flu pandemic in 41 years The H1N1 flu reached over 200 different countries on every continent except Antarctica in the 20092010 flu season fortunately the severity of the disease did not increase The following is the CDC data for mortality and morbidity of the 2009 epidemic in the US final estimates were published in 2011 and state that from Apr 12 2009 to Apr 10 2010 approximately 608 million cases range 433893 million 274304 hospitalizations 195086402719 and 12469 deaths 886818306 occurred in the United States due to H1N1 An outbreak in India that became widespread in that country lasted until late 2016 However in 2017 another outbreak occurred   What is the prognosis outlook and complications for patients who get swine flu  In general the majority about 9095 of people who get the disease feel terrible see symptoms but recover with no problems as seen in patients in Mexico the US and many other countries People with suppressed immune systems historically have worse outcomes than uncompromised individuals investigators suspect that as swine flu spreads the mortality rates may rise and be high in this population Current data suggest that pregnant individuals children under 2 years of age young adults and individuals with any immune compromise or debilitation are likely to have a worse prognosis Complications of swine flu may resemble severe viral pneumonia or the SARS  severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a coronavirus strain outbreak in 20022003 in which the disease spread to about 10 countries with over 7000 cases caused over 700 deaths and had a 10 mortality rate At the beginning of the pandemic the numbers of people with flulike illness were higher than usual and the illness initially affected a much younger population than the conventional flu As the pandemic progressed more young children became infected than usual but the mortality statistics became more similar to the conventional flu mortality rate with an older population especially ages 5064 having the highest death rate Pneumonia viral and secondary bacterial pneumonia is the most serious complication of the flu as it can cause death Other complications include sinus and ear infections  asthma exacerbations andor bronchitis  Where can I find more information about swine flu H1N1 and H3N2v  For additional information see the

reformulations  v t e  The 2009 flu pandemic vaccines are the set of influenza vaccines that have been developed to protect against the pandemic H1N109 virus  These vaccines either contain inactivated killed influenza virus or weakened live virus that cannot cause influenza The killed vaccine is injected while the live vaccine is given as an interperineal nasal spray Both these types of vaccine are usually produced by growing the virus in chicken eggs Around three billion doses will be produced annually with delivery from November 2009 1 2  needs update   In studies the vaccine appears both effective and safe 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 providing a strong protective immune response and having similar safety profile to the normal seasonal influenza vaccine 11 However about 30 of people already have some immunity to the virus with the vaccine conferring greatest benefit on young people since many older people are already immune through exposure to similar viruses in the past 12 The vaccine also provides some crossprotection against the 1918 flu pandemic strain 13  Early results pre25 December 2009 from an observational cohort of 248000 individuals in Scotland have shown the vaccine to be effective at preventing H1N1 influenza 950 effectiveness 95 confidence intervals CI 7601000 and influenza related hospital admissions 647 95CI 120858 14  Developing testing and manufacturing sufficient quantities of a vaccine is a process that takes many months According to Keiji Fukuda of the World Health Organization WHO Theres much greater vaccine capacity than there was a few years ago but there is not enough vaccine capacity to instantly make vaccines for the entire worlds population for influenza 15 Nasal mist version of the vaccine started shipping on 1 October 2009 16  needs

Types of vaccine  edit   Two types of influenza vaccines are available  TIV flu shot  injection  of t rivalent three strains usually AH1N1 A H3N2  and B i nactivated killed v accine or  LAIV nasal spray mist of l ive a ttenuated i nfluenza v accine   TIV works by putting into the bloodstream those parts of three strains of flu virus that the body uses to create antibodies while LAIV works by inoculating the body with those same three strains but in a modified form that cannot cause illness LAIV is not recommended for individuals under age 2 or over age 49 17 but might be comparatively more effective among children over age two 18   Manufacturing methods  edit   For the inactivated vaccines the virus is grown by injecting it along with some antibiotics  into fertilized chicken eggs About one to two eggs are needed to make each dose of vaccine 19 The virus replicates within the allantois of the embryo which is the equivalent of the placenta in mammals The fluid in this structure is removed and the virus purified from this fluid by methods such as filtration or centrifugation  The purified viruses are then inactivated killed with a small amount of a disinfectant The inactivated virus is treated with detergent to break up the virus into particles and the broken capsule segments and released proteins are concentrated by centrifugation The final preparation is suspended in sterile phosphate buffered saline ready for injection 20 This vaccine mainly contains the killed virus but might also contain tiny amounts of egg protein and the antibiotics disinfectant and detergent used in the manufacturing process In multidose versions of the vaccine the preservative thimerosal is added to prevent growth of bacteria In some versions of the vaccine used in Europe and Canada such as Arepanrix and Fluad  an adjuvant is also added this contains a fish oil called squalene  vitamin E and an emulsifier called polysorbate 80  21  For the live vaccine the virus is first adapted to grow at 25 C 77 F and then grown at this temperature until it loses the ability to cause illness in humans which would require the virus to grow at our normal body temperature of 37 C 99 F Multiple mutations are needed for the virus to grow at cold temperatures so this process is effectively irreversible and once the virus has lost virulence become attenuated it will not regain the ability to infect people 22 To make the vaccine the attenuated virus is grown in chicken eggs as before The viruscontaining fluid is harvested and the virus purified by filtration this step also removes any contaminating bacteria The filtered preparation is then diluted into a solution that stabilizes the virus This solution contains monosodium glutamate  potassium phosphate  gelatin  the antibiotic gentamicin  and sugar 23  A new method of producing influenza virus is used to produce the Novartis vaccine Optaflu  In this vaccine the virus is grown in cell culture instead of in eggs 24 This method is faster than the classic eggbased system and produces a purer final product Importantly there are no traces of egg proteins in the final product so the vaccine is safe for people with egg allergies 25 26   Previous seasonal vaccine production  edit   The WHO recommended before the H1N109 outbreak 27 that vaccines for the Northern Hemispheres 20092010 flu season contain an AH1N1 like virus and stocks have been made 28 29 However the strain of H1N1 in the seasonal flu vaccine is different from the new pandemic strain H1N109 and offers no immunity against it 30 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC characterized over 80 new H1N1 viruses that may be used in a vaccine 31   Production questions and decisions  edit   Questions  edit   There was concern in mid2009 that should a second deadlier wave of this new H1N1 strain appear during the northern autumn of 2009 producing pandemic vaccines ahead of time could turn out to be a serious waste of resources as the vaccine might not be effective against it and there would also be a shortage of seasonal flu vaccine available if production facilities were switched to the new vaccine 15 Seasonal flu vaccine was being made as of May 2009 according to WebMD  The news site added that although vaccine makers would be ready to switch to making a swine flu vaccine many questions remained unanswered including Should we really make a swine flu vaccine Should we base a vaccine on the current virus since flu viruses change rapidly Vaccine against the current virus might be far less effective against a changed virus  should we wait to see if the virus changes If vaccine production doesnt start soon swine flu vaccine wont be ready when its needed 32  The costs of producing a vaccine also became an issue with some US lawmakers questioning whether a new vaccine was worth the unknown benefits Representatives Phil Gingrey and Paul Broun  for instance were not convinced that the US should spend up to US2 billion to produce one with Gingrey stating We cant let all of our spending and our reaction be mediadriven in responding to a panic so that we dont get Katrinaed  Its important because what we are talking about as we discuss the appropriateness of spending 2 billion to produce a vaccine that may never be used  that is a very important decision that our country has to make 33 In fact a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found in October 2009 that a majority 62 of New Jerseyans were not planning on getting the vaccine at all 34  Before the pandemic was declared the WHO said that if a pandemic was declared it would attempt to make sure that a substantial amount of vaccine was available for the benefit of developing countries Vaccine makers and countries with standing orders such as the US and a number of European countries would be asked according to WHO officials to share with developing countries from the moment the first batches are ready if an H1N1 vaccine is made for a pandemic strain 35 The global body stated that it wanted companies to donate at least 10 of their production or offer reduced prices for poor countries that could otherwise be left without vaccines if there is a sudden surge in demand 36  Gennady Onishchenko  Russias chief doctor said on 2 June 2009 that swine flu was not aggressive enough to cause a worldwide pandemic noting that the current mortality rate of confirmed cases was 16 in Mexico and only 01 in the United States He stated at a press conference So far it is unclear if we need to use vaccines against the flu because the virus that is now circulating throughout Europe and North America does not have a pandemic nature In his opinion a vaccine could be produced but said that preparing a vaccine now would be considered practice since the world would soon need a new vaccine against a new virus Whats 16000 sick people During any flu season some 10000 a day become ill in Moscow alone he said 37   Production timelines  edit   After a meeting with the WHO on 14 May 2009 pharmaceutical companies said they were ready to begin making a swine flu vaccine According to news reports the WHOs experts will present recommendations to WHO DirectorGeneral Margaret Chan who was expected to issue advice to vaccine manufacturers and the Sixtysecond World Health Assembly 38 39 40 WHOs Keiji Fukuda told reporters These are enormously complicated questions and they are not something that anyone can make in a single meeting Most flu vaccine companies can not make both seasonal flu vaccine and pandemic flu vaccine at the same time Production takes months and it is impossible to switch halfway through if health officials make a mistake If the swine flu mutates scientists arent sure how effective a vaccine made now from the current strain will remain 40 Rather than wait on the WHO decision however some countries in Europe have decided to go ahead with early vaccine orders 41  On 20 May 2009 AP reported Manufacturers wont be able to start making the swine flu vaccine until midJuly at the earliest weeks later than previous predictions according to an expert panel convened by WHO It will then take months to produce the vaccine in large quantities The swine flu virus is not growing very fast in laboratories making it difficult for scientists to get the key ingredient they need for a vaccine the seed stock from the virus  In any case mass producing a pandemic vaccine would be a gamble as it would take away manufacturing capacity for the seasonal flu vaccine for the flu that kills up to 500000 people each year Some experts have wondered whether the world really needs a vaccine for an illness that so far appears mild 42  Another option proposed by the CDC was an earlier rollout of seasonal vaccine according to the CDCs Daniel Jernigan He said the CDC would work with vaccine manufacturers and experts to see if that would be possible and desirable Flu vaccination usually starts in September in the United States and peaks in November Some vaccine experts agree it would be better to launch a second round of vaccinations against the new H1N1 strain instead of trying to add it to the seasonal flu vaccine or replacing one of its three components with the new H1N1 virus 43  The Australian company CSL said that they were developing a vaccine for the swine flu and predicted that a suitable vaccine would be ready by August 44 However John Sterling Editor in Chief of Genetic Engineering  Biotechnology News  said on 2 June It can take five or six months to come up with an entirely novel influenza vaccine There is a great deal of hope that biotech and pharma companies might be able to have something ready sooner 45  As of  September 2009 update a vaccine for H1N109 was expected to be available starting in November 2009 with production of three billion doses per year 1 2 It was expected that two doses would be needed to provide sufficient protection but tests indicated that one dose would be sufficient for adults 46  As of  28 September 2009 update  GlaxoSmithKline produced a vaccine made by growing the virus in hens eggs then breaking and deactivating the virus 47 48 and Baxter International produced a vaccine made in cell culture suitable for those who have an egg allergy The vaccines have been approved for use in the European Union  49 50 51 52 53 54 55   Testing  edit   Initial Phase I human testing began with Novartis  MF59 candidate in July 2009 56 at which time phase II trials of CSLs candidate CSL425 vaccine were planned to start in August 2009 but had not begun recruiting 57  Sanofi Pasteur s candidate inactivated H1N1 had several phase II trials planned as of  21 July 2009 update  but had not begun recruiting 58 News coverage conflicted with this information as Australian trials of the CSL candidate were announced as having started on 21 July 59 and the Chinese government announced the start of trials of the Hualan Biological Engineering candidate 60  Pandemrix  made by GlaxoSmithKline GSK and Focetria  made by Novartis were approved by the European Medicines Agency on 25 September 2009 49 50 51 and Celvapan  made by Baxter was approved the following week 52 53 61 The first comparative clinical study of both vaccines started on children in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2009  citation needed  GSK announced results from clinical trials assessing the use of Pandemrix in children adults and the elderly 62 63 64 65 A 2009 trial examined the safety and efficacy of two different doses of the splitvirus vaccine  and was published in The New England Journal of Medicine  66 The vaccine used in the trial was prepared by CSL Biotherapies in chicken eggs in the same way as the seasonal vaccine A robust immune response was produced in over 90 of patients after a single dose of either 15 or 30 g of antigen This study suggested that the current recommendation for two doses of vaccine are overkill and that a single dose is quite sufficient Arepanrix  an AS03  Adjuvanted H1N1 Pandemic Influenza Vaccine similar to Pandemrix and also made by GSK was authorized by Canadas Minister of Health on 21 October 2009 67 68 69   Adverse events  edit   A review by the US National Institutes of Health NIH concluded that the 2009 H1N1 swine flu vaccine has a safety profile similar to that of seasonal vaccine 11  In an initial clinical trial in Australia nonserious adverse events were reported by about half of the 240 people vaccinated with these events including tenderness and pain at the site of injection headache malaise and muscle pain 66 Two people had more severe events with a much longer spell of nausea muscle pain and malaise that lasted several days The authors stated that the frequency and severity of these adverse events were similar to those normally seen with seasonal influenza vaccines 66 A second trial involved 2200 people ranging from 3 to 77 years of age 70 In this study no patients reported serious adverse events with the most commonly observed events being pain at the injection site and fever which occurred in 1025 of people 70 Although this trial followed up patients individually the Government has been criticized for relying on voluntary reporting for postvaccination evaluation in other circumstances since this is unlikely to accurately measure the percentage of people who get adverse effect 12  As of  19 November 2009 update  the World Health Organization WHO said that 65 million doses of vaccine had been administered and that it had a similar safety profile to the seasonal flu vaccine with no significant differences in the adverse events produced by the different types of vaccine 71 There has been one report of an adverse event per 10000 doses of vaccine with only five percent of these adverse events being serious an overall rate of serious events of one in 200000 doses 71  In Canada after 66 million doses of vaccine had been distributed between 21 October and 7 November there were reports of mild adverse events in 598 people vaccinated including nausea dizziness headache fever vomiting and swelling or soreness at the injection site There were reports of tingling lips or tongue difficulty breathing hives and skin rashes Thirty six people had serious adverse events including anaphylaxis and febrile convulsions The rate of serious adverse events is one in 200000 doses distributed which according to Canadas chief public health officer is less than expected for the seasonal flu vaccine GlaxoSmithKline recalled a batch of vaccine in Canada after it appeared to cause higher rates of adverse events than other batches 72  In the USA 46 million doses had been distributed as of  20 November 2009 update and 3182 adverse events were reported The CDC stated that the vast majority were mild with about one serious adverse event in 260000 doses 73  In Japan around 15 million people had been vaccinated by 31 December 2009 1900 cases of side effects and 104 cases of death were reported from medical institutions The health ministry announced that it will conduct epidemiologic investigation 74  In France around five million people had been vaccinated by 30 December 2009 2657 cases of side effects eight cases of intrauterine death and five cases of miscarriages were reported after vaccination by afssaps  75  Rare potential adverse events are temporary bleeding disorders and GuillainBarr  syndrome GBS a serious condition involving the peripheral nervous system  from which most patients recovery fully within a few months to a year Some studies have indicated that influenzalike illness is itself associated with an increased risk of GBS suggesting that vaccination might indirectly protect against the disorder by protecting against flu 61 According to MariePaule Kieny of WHO assessing the sideeffects of largescale influenza vaccination is complicated by the fact that in any large population a few people will become ill and die at any time 71 For example in any sixweek period in the UK six sudden deaths from unknown causes and 22 cases of GuillainBarr  syndrome would be expected so if everyone in the UK were vaccinated this background rate of illness and death would continue as normal and some people would die simply by chance soon after the vaccination 76  Some scientists have reported concerns about the longerterm effects of the vaccine For instance Sucharit Bhakdi professor of medical microbiology at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in Germany wrote in the journal Medical Microbiology and Immunology  of the possibility that immune stimulation by vaccines or any other cause might worsen preexisting heart disease 77 78 Chris Shaw a neuroscientist at the University of British Columbia expressed concern that serious sideeffects may not appear immediately he said it took five to ten years to see most of the Gulf War syndrome outcomes 77  The CDC states that most studies on modern influenza vaccines have seen no link with GBS 79 79 80 81 Although one review gives an incidence of about one case per million vaccinations 79 82 a large study in China reported in The New England Journal of Medicine covering close to 100 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine found only eleven cases of GuillainBarr  syndrome  10 actually lower than the normal rate of the disease in China 10 and no other notable side effects 10   Pregnant women and children  edit   A 2009 review of the use of influenza vaccines in pregnant women stated that influenza infections posed a major risk during pregnancy and that multiple studies had shown that the inactivated vaccine was safe in pregnant women concluding that this vaccine can be safely and effectively administered during any trimester of pregnancy and that high levels of immunization would avert a significant number of deaths 83 A 2004 review of the safety of influenza vaccines in children stated that the live vaccine had been shown to be safe but that it might trigger wheezing in some children with asthma less data for the trivalent inactivated vaccine was available but no serious symptoms had been seen in clinical trials 84   Squalene  edit   Newsweek states that wild rumours about the swine flu vaccine are being spread through emails it writes that The claims are nearly pure bunk with only trace amounts of fact 85 These rumours generally make unfounded claims that the vaccine is dangerous and they may also promote conspiracy theories  85 For example Newsweek states that some chain emails make false claims about squalene shark liver oil in vaccines The New York Times also notes that antivaccine groups have spread dire warnings about formulations of the vaccine that contain squalene as an adjuvant  86 An adjuvant is a substance that boosts the bodys immune response thereby stretching the supply of the vaccine and helping immunize elderly people with a weak immune system 72 87 Squalene is a normal part of the human body made in the liver and circulating in the blood 88 and is also found in many foods such as eggs and olive oil  89 90 None of the formulations of vaccine used in the US contain squalene or any other adjuvant 89 However some European and Canadian formulations do contain 25 g of squalene per dose which is roughly the amount found in a drop of olive oil 21 91 Some animal experiments have suggested that squalene might be linked to autoimmune disorders 77 92 although others suggest squalene might protect people against cancer 93 94  Squalenebased adjuvants have been used in European influenza vaccines since 1997 with about 22 million doses administered over the past twelve years 95 The WHO states that no severe side effects have been associated with these vaccines although they can produce mild inflammation at the site of injection 95 The safety of squalenecontaining influenza vaccines have also been tested in two separate clinical trials one with healthy nonelderly people 96 and one with elderly people 87 in both trials the vaccine was safe and well tolerated with only weak sideeffects such as mild pain at the injection site A 2009 metaanalysis brought together data from 64 clinical trials of influenza vaccines with the squalenecontaining adjuvant MF59 and compared them to the effects of vaccines with no adjuvant The analysis reported that the adjuvanted vaccines were associated with slightly lower risks of chronic diseases but that neither type of vaccines altered the normal rate of autoimmune diseases the authors concluded that their data supports the good safety profile associated with MF59adjuvanted influenza vaccines and suggests there may be a clinical benefit over nonMF59containing vaccines 97 A 2004 review of the effects of adjuvants on mice and humans concluded that despite numerous case reports on vaccination induced autoimmunity most epidemiological studies failed to confirm the association and the risk appears to be extremely low or nonexistent although the authors noted that the possibility that adjuvants might cause damaging immune reactions in a few susceptible people has not been completely ruled out 98 A 2009 review of oilbased adjuvants in influenza vaccines stated that this type of adjuvant neither stimulates antibodies against squalene oil naturally produced by the humans body nor enhances titers of preexisting antibodies to squalene and that these formulations did not raise any safety concerns 99  A paper published in 2000 suggested that squalene might have caused of Gulf War syndrome by producing antisqualene antibodies 77 100 although other scientists stated that it was uncertain if the methods used were actually capable of detecting these antibodies 101 A 2009 US Department of Defense study comparing healthy Navy personnel to those suffering from Gulf War syndrome was published in the journal Vaccine  this used a validated test for these antibodies and found no link between the presence of the antibodies and illness with about half of both groups having these antibodies and no correlation between symptoms and antibodies 102 Furthermore none of the vaccines given to US troops during the Gulf war actually contained any squalene adjuvants 88 103   Thiomersal  edit   Multidose versions of the vaccine contain the preservative thiomersal also known as thimerosal a mercury compound that prevents contamination when the vial is used repeatedly 104 Singledose versions and the live vaccine do not contain this preservative 104 In the US one dose from a multidose vial contains approximately 25 micrograms of mercury a bit less than a typical tuna fish sandwich  105 106 In Canada different variants contain five and 50 micrograms of thimerosal per dose 107 The use of thiomersal has been controversial  with claims that it can cause autism and other developmental disorders  108 The US Institute of Medicine examined these claims and concluded in 2004 that the evidence did not support any link between vaccines and autism 109 Other reviews came to similar conclusions with a 2006 review in the Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences stating that there is no convincing evidence to support the claim that thimerosal has a causal role in autism 110 and a 2009 review in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases stating that claims that mercury can cause autism are biologically implausible 111 The UK National Health Service stated in 2003 that There is no evidence of longterm adverse effects due to the exposure levels of thiomersal in vaccines 112 The World Health Organization concluded that there is no evidence of toxicity in infants children or adults exposed to thiomersal in vaccines 113 Indeed in 2008 a review noted that even though thiomersal was removed from all US childhood vaccines in 2001 this has not changed the number of autism diagnoses which are still increasing 114   Dystonia  edit   According to the CDC there is no evidence either for or against dystonia being caused by the vaccinations Dystonia is extremely rare Due to the very low numbers of cases dystonia is poorly understood 115 There were only five cases noted that might have been associated with influenza vaccinations over a span of eighteen years 115 In one recent case a woman noted flulike symptoms followed by difficulties with movement and speech starting ten days after a seasonal influenza vaccination 116 However the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation stated that it is unlikely that the symptoms in this case were actually dystonia and stated that there has never been a validated case of dystonia resulting from a flu shot 117   Children vaccine recall  edit   On 15 December 2009 One of the five manufacturers supplying the H1N1 vaccine to the United States recalled thousands of doses because they were not as potent as expected The French manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur voluntarily recalled about 800000 doses of vaccine meant for children between the ages of six months and 35 months The company and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC emphasized that the recall was not prompted by safety concerns and that even though the vaccine is not quite as potent as it is supposed to be children who received it do not need to be immunized again The CDC emphasized that there is no danger for any child who received the recalled vaccine When asked what parents should do CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said absolutely nothing He said if children receive this vaccine they will be fine 118 119   Pandemrixrelated increase of narcolepsy in Finland and Sweden  edit   Main article Pandemrix  In 2010 The Swedish Medical Products Agency MPA and The Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare THL received reports from Swedish and Finnish health care professionals regarding narcolepsy as suspected adverse reaction following Pandemrix flu vaccination The reports concern children aged 1216 years where symptoms compatible with narcolepsy  diagnosed after thorough medical investigation have occurred one to two months after vaccination THL concluded in February 2011 that there is a clear connection between the Pandemrix vaccination campaign of 2009 and 2010 and narcolepsy epidemic in Finland there was a nine times higher probability to get narcolepsy with vaccination than without it 120 121  At the end of March 2011 an MPA press release stated Results from a Swedish registry based cohort study indicate a 4fold increased risk of narcolepsy in children and adolescents below the age of 20 vaccinated with Pandemrix compared to children of the same age that were not vaccinated 122 The same study found no increased risk in adults who were vaccinated with Pandemrix  Availability  edit   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  edit    2500 people line up in a mall in Texas City Texas to receive the H1N1 vaccine from the Galveston County Health Department on 30 October 2009  The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued the following recommendations on who should be vaccinated order is not in priority 123 124 125 126    Pregnant women because they are at higher risk of complications and can potentially provide protection to infants who cannot be vaccinated  Household contacts and caregivers for children younger than 6 months of age because younger infants are at higher risk of influenzarelated complications and cannot be vaccinated Vaccination of those in close contact with infants younger than 6 months old might help protect infants by cocooning them from the virus  Healthcare and emergency medical services personnel because infections among healthcare workers have been reported and this can be a potential source of infection for vulnerable patients Also increased absenteeism in this population could reduce healthcare system capacity  All people from 6 months through 24 years of age Children from 6 months through 18 years of age because cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza have been seen in children who are in close contact with each other in school and day care settings which increases the likelihood of disease spread and  Young adults 19 through 24 years of age because many cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza have been seen in these healthy young adults and they often live work and study in close proximity and they are a frequently mobile population and  Persons aged 25 through 64 years who have health conditions associated with higher risk of medical complications from influenza  Once the demand for these groups has been met at a local level everyone from the ages of 25 through 64 years should be vaccinated too  In addition the CDC recommends  Children through 9 years of age should get two doses of vaccine about a month apart Older children and adults need only one dose 127 128    National Health Service  edit   The UK s National Health Service policy is to provide vaccine in this order of priority 129    People aged between six months and 65 years with chronic lung disease  chronic heart disease  chronic kidney disease  chronic liver disease  chronic neurological disease  diabetes or  suppressed immune system whether due to disease or treatment  All pregnant women  People who live with someone whose immune system is compromised for example people with cancer or HIVAIDS  People aged 65 and over in the seasonal flu vaccine atrisk groups   This excludes the large majority of individuals aged six months to 24 years a group for which the CDC recommends vaccination The NHS notes that  Healthy people over 65 years of age seem to have some natural immunity  Children while disproportionately affected tend to make full recoveries  The vaccine is ineffective in young infants  The United Kingdom began its administration program 21 October 2009 UK Soldiers serving in Afghanistan will also be offered vaccination 130 131   Surplus vaccine  edit   By April 2010 it was apparent that most of the vaccine was not needed The US government had bought 229 million doses of H1N1 vaccines of which 91 million doses were used of the surplus some of it was stored in bulk some of it was sent to developing countries and 71 million doses will be destroyed 132 The World Health Organization is planning to examine if it overreacted to the H1N1 outbreak 132   Political issues  edit    US President  Barack Obama receives the vaccine on 20 December 2009  General political issues not restricted to the 2009 outbreak arose regarding the distribution of vaccine In many countries supplies are controlled by national or local governments and the question of how the vaccine will be allocated should there be an insufficient supply for everyone is critical and will likely depend on the patterns of any pandemic and the age groups most at risk for serious complications including death In the case of a lethal pandemic people will be demanding access to the vaccine and the major problem will be making it available to those who need it 133  While it has been suggested that compulsory vaccination may be needed to control a pandemic many countries do not have a legal framework that would allow this The only populations easily compelled to accept vaccination are military personnel who can be given routine vaccinations as part of their service obligations health care personnel who can be required to be vaccinated to protect patients  citation needed  and school children who under United States constitutional law could be required to be vaccinated as a condition of attending school 134   See

April 2009 and never went away After sweeping the globe US H1N1 swine flu cases surged as schools opened in the fall What is H1N1 swine flu What can we do about it WebMD answers your questions    What is swine flu    What are swine flu symptoms    Who is at highest risk of H1N1 swine flu     Help Ive been exposed to swine flu What should I do     If I think I have swine flu what should I do    How does swine flu spread    How is swine flu treated    Is there a vaccine against the new swine flu virus    I had a flu vaccine this season Am I protected against swine flu    How can I prevent swine flu infection    Should I wear a face mask or respirator    How long does the flu virus survive on surfaces    Can I still eat pork    What else should I be doing during the swine flu pandemic     How severe is swine flu    Have there been previous swine flu outbreaks    I was vaccinated against the 1976 swine flu virus Am I still protected    How many people have swine flu    How serious is the public health threat of a swine flu epidemic        What is swine flu   Swine  flu  also known as 2009 H1N1 type A influenza  is a human disease People get the disease from other people not from pigs  The disease originally was nicknamed swine flu because the virus that causes the d isease originally jumped to humans from the live pigs in which it evolved The virus is a reassortant  a mix of genes from swine bird and human flu vir uses Scientists are still arguing about what the virus should be called but most people know it as the H1N1 swine flu virus  The swine flu viruses that usually spread among pigs arent the same as human flu viruses Swine flu doesnt often infect people and the rare human cases that have occurred in the past have mainly affected people who had direct contact with pigs But the current swine flu outbreak is different Its caused by a new swine flu virus that has changed in ways that allow it to spread from person to person  among people who havent had any contact with pigs     Continued    That makes it a human flu virus To distinguish it from flu viruses that infect mainly pigs and from the seasonal influenza A H1N1 viruses that have been in circulation for many years the CDC calls the virus 2009 H1N1 virus Other names include novel H1N1 or nH1N1 quadruple assortant H1N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1   Many people have at least partial immunity to seasonal H1N1 viruses because theyve been infected with or vaccinated against this flu bug These viruses drift genetically which is why the flu vaccine has to be tweaked from time to time  But the H1N1 swine flu is not the usual drift variant of H1N1 It came to humans from a di fferent line of evolution That means most people have no natural immunity to H1N1 swine flu The normal seasonal flu shot does not protect against this new virus  Some people who may have had seasonal H1N1 flu before 1957 might have a little bit of protective immunity against the new virus Thats because seasonal H1N1 flu strains that circulated before 1957 and which were replaced by the 1957 pandemic flu bug were genetically closer to the 2009 H1N1 swine flu This protection is not complete While relatively few elderly people have had H1N1 swine flu many of those who did get the disease became severely ill    What are swine flu symptoms   Symptoms of H1N1 swine flu are like regular flu symptoms and include fever cough  sore throat  runny nose  body aches headache  chills and fatigue  Many people with swine flu have had diarrhea and vomiting  But these symptoms can also be caused by many other conditions That means that you and your doctor cant know just based on your symptoms if youve got swine flu Health care professionals may offer a rapid flu test  although a negative result doesnt mean you dont have the flu The accuracy of the test depends on the quality of the manufacturers test the sample collection method and how much virus a person is shedding at the time of testing     Continued    Like seasonal flu pandemic swine flu can cause neurologic symptoms in children These events are rare but as cases associated with seasonal flu have shown they can be very severe and often fatal Symptoms include seizures or changes in mental status confusion or sudden cognitive or behavioral changes Its not clear why these symptoms occur although they may be caused by Reyes syndrome Reyes syndrome usually occurs in children with a viral illness who have taken aspirin  something that should always be avoided   Only lab tests can definitively show whether youve got swine flu State health departments can do these tests During the peak of the pandemic these tests were reserved for patients with severe flu symptoms     Who is at highest risk from H1N1 swine flu   Most US cases of H1N1 swine flu have been in children and youn g adults Its not clear whether this will change as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic wanes and the virus becomes a seasonal flu bug   But certain groups are at particularly high risk of severe disease or bad outcomes if they get the flu     Pregnant women are six times more likely to have severe flu disease than women who are not pregnant   Young children especially those under 2 years of age    People with asthma    People with COPD or other chronic lung conditions    People with cardiovascular conditions except high blood pressure    People with liver problems    People with kidney problems    People with blood disorders including sickle cell disease    People with neurologic disorders    People with neuromuscular disorders    People with metabolic disorders including diabetes    People with immune suppression including HIV infection and medications that suppress the immune system such as cancerchemotherapy or antirejection drugs for transplants    Residents of a nursing home or other chroniccare facility    Elderly people are at high risk of severe flu disease  if they get it Relatively few swine flu cases have been seen in people over age 65     People in these groups should seek medical care as soon as they get flu symptoms    A striking number of adults who developed severe swine flu complications have been morbidly ob  ese While the vast majority of extremely obese people suffer respiratory problems andor diabetes which make flu worse obesity itself is now considered a risk for serious 2009 H1N1 flu      Continued   Help Ive been exposed to H1N1 swine flu What should I do    If   you come into close contact with a person who has the flu  especially if that person did not cover a cough or sneeze when you were within 6 feet  youve been exposed Exposure does not guarantee infection or illness so theres still a good chance you wont get the flu    What you should do next depends on your risk for getting severe disease and on the risk of severe disease in others with whom you cannot avoid contact    If you have any of the conditions that put you at increased risk of severe H1N1 swine flu  pregnancy asthma lung disease diabetes heart disease neurologic disease immune suppression or other chronic conditions  it may be riskier for you to get the flu than for other people That also goes for children under age 2 years young people under age 19 taking daily aspirin therapy and people over age 65 And if you are a caretaker for an infant under age 6 months that child is at risk of severe disease if he or she catches the flu from you    The CDC advises against the use of the antiflu drugs Tamiflu and Relenza to keep exposed people from getting the flu Thats because most of the few cases of drugresistant H1N1 swine flu have popped up in people taking Tamiflu to prevent flu    Instead the CDC advises atrisk individuals to call their health care providers if they are exposed to flu The provider may choose to write a prescription for Tamiflu or Relenza to be filled only if flu symptoms appear Or the provider may ask the patient to call again at the first sign of flu at which time a prescription will be written    Dont wait for a rapid flu test The tests often give negative results even in people who really have H1N1 swine flu If youve got flu symptoms and youre at risk of severe disease start taking flu drugs right away The drugs work best when taken within 48 hours of the first symptom although even when taken much later they can prevent severe illness      Continued    What if you arent at risk and dont have to care for an infant    In that case the CDCs basic advice is for you to stock up on chicken soup line up some tender loving care and plan to stay home if you get sick The vast majority of otherwise healthy people who get H1N1 swine flu pull through just fine after a few miserable days of flu symptoms    BUT The flu is a tricky disease If you do get the flu and develop any of the warning signs of severe disease  especially trouble breathing or getting worse after feeling better  call your doctor right away Its especially important to watch younger children for signs of severe disease such as irritability refusal to eat trouble waking bluish or grayish skin color or a fever that goes down and then shoots back up     If I think I have swine flu what should I do When should I see my doctor    If   you have flu symptoms stay home and when you cough or sneeze cover your mouth and nose with a tissue Afterward throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands That will help prevent your flu from spreading If you can do it comfortably wear a surgical mask if you must be around others    If you have only mild flu symptoms you do not need medical attention unless your illness gets worse But if you are in one of the groups at high risk of severe disease contact your doctor at the first sign of flulike illness In such cases the CDC recommends that people call or email their doctor before rushing to an emergency room   But heed these signs of a medical emergency   Children should be given urgent medical attention if they   Have fast breathing or trouble breathing  Have bluish or gray skin color  Are not drinking enough fluid  Are not waking up or not interacting  Have severe or persistent vomiting  Are so irritable that the child does not want to be held  Have flulike symptoms that improve but then return with fever and a worse cough  Have fever with a rash   Have a fever and then have a seizure or sudden mental or behavioral change       Continued    Adults should seek urgent medical attention if they have   Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath  Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen  Sudden dizziness  Confusion  Severe or persistent vomiting  Flulike symptoms that improve but then come back with worsening fever or cough   Keep in mind that your doctor will not be able to determine whether you have H1N1 swine flu but he or she may take a sample from you and send it to a state health department lab for testing to see if its swine flu If your doctor suspects swine flu he or she would be able to write you a prescription for Tamiflu or Relenza  These antiviral medications arent a question of life or death for the vast majority of people Most US swine flu patients have made a full recovery without antiviral drugs    How does swine flu spread Is it airborne   The new H1N1 swine flu virus apparently spreads just like regular flu You could pick up germs directly from airborne droplets from the cough or sneeze of an infected person You could also pick up the virus by touching an object contaminated by the cough or touch of an infected person and then touching your eyes  mouth  or nose Thats why you should make washing your hands a habit even when youre not ill Infected people can start spreading flu germs up to a day before symptoms start and for up to seven days after getting sick according to the CDC   The H1N1 swine flu virus like the seasonal flu virus can become airborne if you cough or sneeze without covering your nose and mouth sending germs into the air Ferret studies suggest that swine flu spreads less easily by small airborne droplets than does seasonal flu But it does spread by this route and it may begin to spread even more readily as the new virus fully adapts to humans    The H1N1 swine flu virus is a human virus spread by people and not by pigs The only way to get the new swine flu is from another person      Continued   How is swine flu treated    Pandemic   H1N1 swine flu virus is sensitive to the antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza These antiviral drugs are most effective when taken within 48 hours of the start of flu symptoms Its resistant to older flu drugs    A third antiviral drug peramivir can be used only in hospitalized patients with severe flu Peramivir is an intravenous drug approved for use under the FDAs Emergency Use Authorization    Not everyone needs treatment with these antiflu drugs Most people who come down with H1N1 swine flu recover fully  without antiviral treatment    But the CDC strongly recommends antiviral treatment for people at risk of severe flu complications who come down with flulike symptoms Since its very important to start these drugs soon after symptoms appear doctors should offer treatment to atrisk patients if they suspect they have the flu Doctors should not rely on rapid flu tests they are too unreliable for definitive diagnosis or wait for results of labbased tests because they take too long    Early treatment is so important that the CDC suggests doctors offer a Tamiflu or Relenza prescription to atrisk patients If these patients develop flulike symptoms they would call their doctor and based on the doctors clinical judgment the patient could then simply fill the prescription   Many people who have died of H1N1 swine flu had bacterial coinfections particularly pneumococcal infections Theres a vaccine against pneumococcal infections Its routine for children and recommended for adults with underlying health conditions smokers or people over age 65 If your flu symptoms get worse after getting better call your doctor You may need treatment with antibiotic medications   Is there enough Tamiflu and Relenza to go around Federal and state stockpiles are large enough to treat atrisk patients with flu symptoms But there isnt enough to offer treatment to otherwise healthy people who may have the flu And health officials have asked people not to hoard Tamiflu or Relenza    Tamiflu and Relenza can prevent swine flu but the CDC urges even atrisk people to try to avoid using the drugs in this way Not only is supply insufficient for preventive use but preventive use appears to be a major factor in the few cases of drugresistant H1N1 swine flu that have appeared    There are situations in which preventive use of Tamiflu or Relenza may be appropriate for an atrisk person who must come into close contact with someone who has the flu But the CDC suggests that doctors consider a watchful waiting approach In this case the atrisk person would wait to fill the prescription only if she or he actually developed flu symptoms        Continued   Is there a vaccine against the new swine flu virus    Yes   The problem was that the main wave of the pandemic hit the US in September 2009 Vaccine production was delayed by a lowerthanexpected yield of vaccine from the chicken eggs in which vaccine virus is grown It wasnt until the end of January 2010 that every US resident who wanted the vaccine could get it By then many people either already had the flu or figured the danger had passed    By midsummer 2010 there was only a trickle of H1N1 infections but deaths and hospitalizations continued among atrisk people who had not been vaccinated    When the vaccine for the 20102011 flu season is ready it will include the 2009 H1N1 vaccine as well as a vaccine against two other seasonal flu bugs    Clinical tests show the 2009 H1N1 vaccine works remarkably well People ages 10 and older need only one dose of the vaccine Protection begins about eight days after vaccination Kids under age 10 will need two vaccinations given three weeks apart The vaccine is highly effective  and according to early results from clinical trials very safe  in pregnant women    Extensive safety surveillance as of June 2010 showed no problems linked to the vaccine GuillianBarre syndrome GBS a rare neurological syndrome can be triggered by flu vaccines The seasonal flu vaccine causes about one extra case of GBS among every million people vaccinated CDC data suggest that the 2009 H1N1 vaccine increased GBS cases by about the same amount    Does this mean the swine flu vaccine is 100 safe No Rare vaccine reactions do happen even with the seasonal flu vaccine But flu experts at the National Institutes of Health the CDC and the FDA note that getting the flu is far more risky than getting the vaccine    Spurred by the safety concerns that sank vaccination efforts during the 1976 swine flu scare a scare caused by a very different generation of flu vaccine against a very different swine flu virus federal officials have increased efforts to track the safety of the H1N1 swine flu vaccine In addition to beefing up the CDCs and FDAs vaccine adverseevent surveillance system health care organizations academic medical centers and the US military will be helping track vaccine safety An advisory board made up of nongovernment advisors performs frequent reviews of the safety data   The vaccine will be available to all US residents As were all in this together nobody will be asked to provide proof of citizenship or legal immigration  Vaccination is not mandatory for most US residents Activeduty military and Defense Department personnel are required to get the vaccine And healthcare workers may be required to get the vaccine by their employers or by state regulations     Continued   I had a flu vaccine this season Am I protected against swine flu    No    The 20092010 seasonal flu vaccine did not protect against the new swine flu virus    But the 20102011 seasonal flu vaccine will protect against the 2009 H1N1 swine flu Dont wait for this vaccine if you are at high risk of serious flu The 2009 H1N1 virus is still circulating While there have been few infections in 2010 hospitalizations and deaths continue       How can I prevent swine flu infection   The CDC recommends taking these steps    Wash your hands regularly with soap and water especially after coughing or sneezing Scrub for at least 20 seconds and rinse thoroughly    If soap and water are not available wash your hands with an alcoholbased hand gel Rub your hands together until the alcohol dries completely    Avoid close contact  that is being within 6 feet  with people who have flulike symptoms    Avoid touching your mouth nose or eyes Thats not easy to do so keep those hands clean    If you have flulike symptoms  fever plus at least cough or sore throat or other flu symptoms  stay home for seven days after symptoms begin or until youve been symptomfree for 24 hours  whichever is longer    Wear a face mask consider using an N95 respirator if you must come into close contact with a sick person Close contact means within 6 feet Note There is no definitive proof that a face mask prevents flu transmission Do not rely solely on a face mask to prevent infection    Wear an N95 respirator if helping a sick person with a nebulizer inhaler or other respiratory treatment Note There is no definitive proof that a respirator prevents flu transmission Do not rely solely on a respirator to prevent infection    People who have or are suspected of having swine flu should wear a face mask if available and tolerable when sharing common spaces with other household members when outside the home or when near children or infants    Breastfeeding mothers with swine flu symptoms should express their breast milk and the child should be fed by someone else         Continued   Should I wear a face mask or respirator    Short answer Maybe Face masks and respirators may very well offer extra protection but should not be your first line of defense against either pandemic or seasonal flu     Every day newspapers carry pictures of people wearing face masks to prevent swine flu transmission But very little is known about whether face masks actually protect against the flu    Theres a difference between a face mask and a respirator A face mask does not seal tightly to the face Face masks include masks labeled as surgical dental medical procedure isolation or laser masks Respirators are N95 or higherrated filtering face pieces that fit snugly to the face Respirators filter out virus particles when correctly adjusted  which is not as simple as it sounds But its hard to breathe through them for extended periods and they cannot be worn by children or by people with facial hair    People who have flulike symptoms should carry disposable tissues to cover their coughs and sneezes When going out in public or when sharing common spaces around the home with family members they should put on a face mask  if one is available and tolerable    People not at risk of severe flu illness can best protect themselves from swine flu with frequent hand washing and by staying at least 6 feet away from people with flu symptoms But if swine flu is circulating in the community a face mask or respirator may be protective in crowded public places    People at increased risk of severe flu illness  pregnant women for example  should add a face mask to these triedandtrue precautions when providing assistance to a person with flulike illness And anyone else who cannot avoid close contact with someone who has swine flu if you must hold a sick infant for example may try using a face mask or respirator     How long does the flu virus survive on surfaces   Flu bugs can survive for hours on surfaces One study showed that flu viruses can live for up to 48 hours on hard nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and for up to 12 hours on cloth and tissues The virus seems to survive for only minutes on your hands  but thats plenty of time for you to transfer it to your mouth nose or eyes      Continued   Can I still eat pork   Yes You cant get swine flu by eating pork bacon ham or other foods that come from pigs You can only get the 2009 H1N1 swine flu from another person    What else should I be doing during the swine flu pandemic   Keep informed of whats going on in your community Your state and local health departments may have important information if swine flu develops in your area For instance parents might want to consider what they would do if their childs school temporarily closed because of flu Dont panic  but a little planning wouldnt hurt  Heres the advice from the US governments pandemicflugov web site  To plan for a pandemic   Store a twoweek supply of water and food During a pandemic if you cannot get to a store or if stores are out of supplies it will be important for you to have extra supplies on hand This can be useful in other types of emergencies such as power outages and disasters  Periodically check your regular prescription drugs to ensure a continuous supply in your home  Have any nonprescription drugs and other health supplies on hand including pain relievers stomach remedies cough and cold medicines fluids with electrolytes  and vitamins   Talk with family members and loved ones about how they would be cared for if they got sick or what will be needed to care for them in your home  Volunteer with local groups to prepare and assist with emergency response  Get involved in your community as it works to prepare for an influenza pandemic   Items to have on hand for an extended stay at home      Examples of food and nonperishables      Examples of medical health and emergency supplies        Readytoeat canned meats fish fruits vegetables beans and soups     Prescribed medical supplies such as glucose and blood pressure monitoring equipment       Protein or fruit bars     Soap and water or alcoholbased 6095 hand wash       Dry cereal or granola     Medicines for fever such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen       Peanut butter or nuts     Thermometer       Dried fruit     Antidiarrheal medication       Crackers     Vitamins       Canned juices     Fluids with electrolytes       Bottled water     Cleansing agentsoap       Canned or jarred baby food and formula     Flashlight       Pet food     Batteries       Other nonperishable items     Portable radio           Manual can opener           Garbage bags           Tissues toilet paper disposable diapers          Continued   How severe is swine flu    The   severity of cases in the current swine flu outbreak has varied widely from mild cases to fatalities Most US cases have been mild but there have been a number of tragic deaths and hundreds of hospitalizations  mostly in young people aged 5 to 24 Pregnant women have been particularly vulnerable to severe flu and death    Like seasonal flu children who get swine flu can have serious neurological complications such as seizures and Reyes syndrome But as with seasonal flu these complications fortunately are rare    Studies of the swine flu virus show that it is more infectious to lung cells than are seasonal flu viruses But studies also suggest that the swine flu virus is less well adapted to humans and may be harder to inhale deep into the lungs    Flu viruses change all the time The way the pandemic swine flu virus evolved suggests that it is particularly liable to swap gene segments with other flu viruses But so far the swine flu virus hasnt changed much Thats good news as the vast majority of swine flu cases have been mild And its also good news for the swine flu vaccine which is based on swine flu strains isolated early in the pandemic    Its impossible to know whether the virus will become more deadly Scientists are watching closely to see which way the new swine flu virus is heading  but health experts warn that flu viruses are notoriously hard to predict    But theres a lot of planning you can do CDC officials predict that just about every US community will have H1N1 swine flu cases Its possible some schools in your community may temporarily close or even that major gatherings may be canceled So make contingency plans just in case you are affected For more information on preparedness planning see the US governments pandemicflugov web site     Have there been previous swine flu oubtreaks   Yes  but never before has there been a swine flu pandemic Pigs can be infected with a wide range of flu viruses Once in a while a person in close contact with pigs becomes infected Its not possible to get swine flu from eating pork  In 1976 there was an outbreak of swineorigin flu among military recruits in Ft Dix NJ Some of these young men died Health experts on the lookout for the next flu pandemic thought the infection would spread further and launched a vaccination campaign As it turned out the virus never spread and disappeared on its own Because the vaccine carried a small increased risk of severe neurological problems  and because there was no benefit in a vaccine for a pandemic that never happened  the vaccination campaign was stopped     Continued   I was vaccinated against the 1976 swine flu virus Am I still protected   Probably not  The new swine flu virus is different from the 1976 virus And its not clear whether a vaccine given more than 30 years ago would still be effective    How many people have swine flu    Thats   no longer possible to answer definitively because so many people have become infected that most nations can no longer test everyone suspected of having H1N1 swine flu The CDC counts hospitalizations and deaths but even these figures underestimate the true extent of the pandemic Instead of misleading case counts the CDC has estimated the number of cases hospitalizations and deaths     The CDC estimates that between 43 million and 89 million cases of 2009 H1N1 occurred between April 2009 and April 10 2010 The midlevel in this range is about 61 million people infected with 2009 H1N1    The CDC estimates that between 195000 and 403000 H1N1related hospitalizations occurred between April 2009 and April 10 2010 The midlevel in this range is about 274000 2009 H1N1related hospitalizations    The CDC estimates that between about 8870 and 18300 2009 H1N1related deaths occurred between April 2009 and April 10 2010 The midlevel in this range is about 12470 2009 H1N1related deaths        How serious is the public health threat of a swine flu epidemic    The   US government declared swine flu to be a public health emergency The World Health Organization considers it a global emergency    As of June 2010 the WHO still considered the world to be in a flu pandemic That inevitably will change probably before the end of winter in the Southern Hemisphere summer in the Northern Hemisphere    As the pandemic winds down the WHO will declare the world to be in a postpeak period meaning that the spread of flu has slowed to a trickle and that new waves of infection are possible but unlikely Finally the WHO will announce the postpandemic period meaning that the pandemic is over and that the 2009 H1N1 virus has become a seasonal flu bug    Despite more than 12000 US deaths in relatively young people and many more deaths worldwide the 2009 H1N1 virus was not as bad as it could have been The virus never incorporated virulence factors that would have made illness much worse nor did the virus evolve into a nightmare plague In fact the virus remained unchanged throughout the first year of the pandemic      Continued      WebMD senior writer Miranda Hitti contributed to this report      WebMD Feature  Reviewed by Louise  Chang MD on

an influenza virus that causes symptoms similar to the regular flu It originated in pigs but is spread primarily from person to person Swine flu made headlines in 2009 when it was first discovered in humans and became a pandemic Pandemics are contagious diseases affecting people throughout the world or on multiple continents at the same time The World Health Organization WHO declared the H1N1 pandemic over in August 2010 Since then the H1N1 virus has been known as a regular human flu virus It continues to spread during flu season like other strains of the flu The flu shot developed each year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC usually includes a vaccination against a type of H1N1 virus Read more Importance of getting a flu shot for flu season  Like other strains of the flu H1N1 is highly contagious allowing it to spread quickly from person to person A simple sneeze can cause thousands of germs to spread through the air The virus can linger on tables and surface areas like door knobs waiting to be picked up The best means of dealing with swine flu is to prevent it Hand sanitization is important to stop the spread of the virus Staying away from infected people will help stop persontoperson transmission Start sanitizing now Risk
factors for swine flu When it first emerged swine flu was most common in children 5 years and older and young adults This was unusual because most flu virus infections are a higher risk for complications in older adults or the very young Today risk factors for getting swine flu are the same as for any other strain of the flu Youre most at risk if you spend time in an area with a large number of people who are infected with swine flu Some people are at higher risk for becoming seriously ill if theyre infected with swine flu These groups include adults over age 65 children under 5 years old young adults and children under age 19 who are receiving longterm aspirin Bufferin therapy people with compromised immune systems due to a disease such as AIDS  pregnant women people with chronic illnesses such as asthma  heart disease  diabetes mellitus  or neuromuscular disease Causes
of swine flu Swine flu is caused by a strain of influenza virus that usually only infects pigs Unlike typhus  which can be transmitted by lice or ticks  transmission usually occurs from person to person not animal to person You cant catch swine flu from eating properly cooked pork products Swine flu is very contagious The disease is spread through saliva and mucus particles People may spread it by sneezing coughing touching a germcovered surface and then touching their eyes or nose Symptoms
of swine flu The symptoms of swine flu are very much like those of regular influenza  They include chills fever coughing sore throat runny or stuffy nose body aches fatigue diarrhea nausea and vomiting Diagnosing
swine flu Your doctor can make a diagnosis by sampling fluid from your body To take a sample your doctor or a nurse may swab your nose or throat The swab will be analyzed using various genetic and laboratory techniques to identify the specific type of virus Learn more Throat swab culture  Treating
swine flu Most cases of swine flu dont require medication for treatment You dont need to see a doctor unless youre at risk for developing medical complications from the flu You should focus on relieving your symptoms and preventing the spread of the H1N1 to other people Two antiviral drugs are recommended for treating swine flu the oral drugs oseltamivir Tamiflu and zanamivir Relenza Because flu viruses can develop resistance to these drugs theyre often reserved for people who are at high risk for complications from the flu People who are otherwise generally healthy and get swine flu will be able to fight the infection on their own Swine
flu symptom relief Methods for managing the symptoms of swine flu are similar to the regular flu Get plenty of rest This will help your immune system focus on fighting the infection Drink plenty of water and other liquids to prevent dehydration  Soup and clear juices will help replenish your body of lost nutrients Take overthecounter pain relievers for symptoms such as headache and sore throat Read more 11 Cold and flu home remedies  Outlook
for swine flu Severe cases of swine flu can be fatal Most fatal cases occur in those with underlying chronic medical conditions such as HIV or AIDS The majority of people with swine flu recover and can anticipate a normal life expectancy Preventing
swine flu The best way to prevent swine flu is to get a yearly flu vaccination Other easy ways to prevent swine flu include frequently washing hands with soap or hand sanitizer not touching your nose mouth or eyes The virus can survive on surfaces like telephones and tabletops staying home from work or school if youre ill avoiding large gatherings when swine flu is in season Its important to follow any public health recommendations regarding school closures or avoiding crowds during the flu season These recommendations may come from the CDC WHO National Institutes of Health or other governmental public health institutions Flu season shifts from year to year but in the United States it generally starts in October and runs until as late as May It usually peaks in January although its possible to get the flu any time of year Healthline and our partners may receive a portion of revenues if you make a purchase using a link above Medically reviewed by Stacy Sampson DO on May 30 2017  Written by Lydia Krause and Joanna Poceta related stories When the Flu Turns Deadly Stock Up 8 Products You Should Have on Hand for Flu Season Stomach Flu Remedies How to Use Essential Oils for the Flu Does Wearing a Mask Prevent the Flu READ THIS NEXT When the Flu Turns Deadly For most people the flu presents a few days of feeling miserable For others including very young children and the elderly the flu can be more READ MORE Stock Up 8 Products You Should Have on Hand for Flu Season Here are eight products to help prevent you from getting sick and also to help you feel better if you come down with the flu READ MORE Stomach Flu Remedies The stomach flu is caused by a virus that attacks your gastrointestinal system Its common to experience symptoms such as chills fever vomiting READ MORE How to Use Essential Oils for the Flu Looking for a natural remedy for the flu Well show you 10 essential oils that can fight the flu and how to use them READ MORE Does Wearing a Mask Prevent the Flu For many years scientists werent sure if wearing a mask was effective at preventing the spread of viruses However recent studies suggest that they READ MORE 7 Ways to FluProof Your Home Check out our top seven tips for preventing the spread of flu in your house READ MORE Everything You Need to Know About the Flu The flu and the common cold may seem very similar at first Heres what you need to know to correctly identify the flu and get the treatment you need READ MORE How to Treat a Cold or Flu When Youre Pregnant Treating a cold or flu during pregnancy can be a bit more complicated In the past you may have taken an overthecounter OTC decongestant But now READ MORE Flu Shot Learn the Side Effects The flu vaccine which typically comes as a shot or nasal spray can reduce your chances of getting the flu by as much as 60 percent Side effects READ MORE What Ingredients Are in the Flu Shot The flu shot has been found to be safe for most people Learn more about the ingredients in the vaccine READ MORE CMS Id 21729

H1N1 pandemic and has not been updated    The H1N1 virus that caused that pandemic is now a regular human flu virus and continues to circulate seasonally worldwide  The English language content on this website is being archived for historic and reference purposes only   For current updated information on seasonal flu including information about H1N1 see the CDC Seasonal Flu website     Questions  Answers  Vaccine against 2009 H1N1 Influenza Virus      On this Page    Recommendations for Vaccine against 2009 H1N1 Influenza Virus  Late Season Recommendations  Supply and Distribution  Vaccines for the 20092010 Influenza Season  Prior Vaccination or Illness  Prevention            Recommendations for Vaccine against 2009 H1N1 Influenza Virus  Will the vaccine against 2009 H1N1 influenza virus also called swine flu be the same vaccine in 2010  Yes the vaccine to protect against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus will be the same for the entire 20092010 influenza season which extends into the spring of 2010 The 2009 in the name only relates to the year the virus was first identified it does not have to do with how long the vaccine will work or the year in which it should be administered The 2009 H1N1 virus is not included in the 20092010 seasonal flu vaccine because it was identified after manufacturers had started making the seasonal flu vaccine  Who should get the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine  When vaccine to protect against 2009 H1N1 first became available supplies were limited  For this reason CDC s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP recommended that people at highest risk for complications from this virus or those caring for high risk individuals who cannot receive vaccination receive the vaccine first These target groups included pregnant women people who live with or care for children younger than 6 months of age health care and emergency medical services personnel anyone 6 months through 24 years of age and people ages of 25 through 64 years of age at higher risk for 2009 H1N1 influenza because of certain chronic health conditions or compromised immune systems   httpwwwflugovwidgetsvaccinelocatorhtml   ACIP recognized the need to assess supply and demand issues at the local level The committee further recommended that once the demand for vaccine for these target groups had been met at the local level programs and providers should begin vaccinating everyone from ages 25 through 64 years Studies at that time indicated that the risk for infection among people 65 and older was less than the risk for younger age groups so people 65 and older were not initially targeted to receive early doses of vaccine However ACIP noted that as vaccine supply increased and demand for vaccine among younger age groups is being met programs and providers should also offer vaccination to people over the age of 65  At this time many states have already opened up vaccination to anyone who wants it and while people 65 and older are still less likely to get sick with 2009 H1N1 severe infections and deaths have occurred in every age group including older people  CDC is now encouraging those who have been patiently waiting to receive the 2009 H1N1 vaccine including people 65 and older to get vaccinated depending on local supply  Separate recommendations are available for seasonal influenza  Who Should Get Vaccinated Against Seasonal Influenza   How many doses of vaccine are required  The US Food and Drug Administration FDA has approved the use of one dose of vaccine against 2009 H1N1 influenza virus for persons 10 years of age and older For children who are 6 months through 9 years of age two doses of the vaccine are recommended  These two doses should be separated by 4 weeks  Infants younger than 6 months of age are too young to get any influenza vaccine  Why does my  child need two doses of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine dose  The recommendation that children younger  than 10 years old receive 2 doses of 2009 H1N1 vaccine was based on studies of  immune response to the vaccine as measured by levels of protective antibodies  in the blood After 1 dose of vaccine infants and young children do not make  as many antibodies compared with older children and adults who get 1 dose   In addition effectiveness of seasonal flu  vaccine is much less for young children who have never been vaccinated before  and only get 1 dose compared with young children who have never been vaccinated  before and get 2 doses   Persons who have some antibody from  previous vaccination or exposure to infection with another related flu strain  will have much greater increases in antibody to flu vaccines Studies that  looked at blood samples taken from children before the pandemic indicate that  very few children had any measurable immunity against 2009 H1N1 prior to the  outbreak  Therefore all children younger than 10 should get 2 doses regardless of  whether they ever have been given seasonal influenza vaccine       What is the recommended interval between the first and second dose for children 6 months through 9 years of age  CDC recommends that the two doses of vaccine against 2009 H1N1 influenza virus be separated by 4 weeks However if the second dose is separated from the first dose by at least 21 days the second dose can be considered valid  A few months have past since my child  received the first 2009 H1N1 vaccine should I have her receive the 2nd  dose  CDC recommends that  the two doses of vaccine against 2009 H1N1 influenza virus be separated by 4  weeks If the second dose is administered beyond 4 weeks the body s immune  system still remembers the first dose and develops antibodies or protection  against 2009 H1N1 influenza virus  Research  shows that the immune system will not develop adequate protection if the  vaccine dosing interval is  21 days  Can people who are allergic to eggs receive the vaccine against 2009 H1N1 influenza virus  People who are allergic to eggs might be at risk for allergic reactions from receiving any influenza vaccine People who have had any of the following symptoms or experiences should consult with a doctor or other medical professional before considering any influenza vaccination   hives or swelling of the lips or tongue after eating eggs  acute respiratory distress trouble breathing after eating eggs  documented hypersensitivity to eggs including those who have had asthma related to egg exposure at their workplace or other allergic responses to egg protein   Because children with severe asthma are at high risk of serious complications from influenza a regimen has been developed for giving influenza vaccine to children with severe asthma and egg hypersensitivity   Late Season Recommendations  Why should flu be taken seriously  Flu should never be dismissed as  just the flu  It s a serious disease  and while most cases are mild some can be deadly  So far this flu season most flu activity has been caused  by the 2009 H1N1 virus which was first identified in April 2009 and caused the  first flu pandemic in 40 years  Because  many people with influenza illness are not tested for flu or are tested late in  their illness methods have been developed to estimate the numbers of people  with influenza illness and with influenzarelated complications including  hospitalizations and deaths  CDC estimates  that from April to January 16 2010 approximately 57 million cases of 2009  H1N1 occurred in the United    States including 257000 H1N1related  hospitalizations and about 11690 deaths   With  2009 H1N1 approximately 90 of estimated hospitalizations and 87 of estimated  deaths from April through January 16 2010 occurred in people younger than 65  years old  In contrast with seasonal  influenza about 60 of seasonal  flurelated hospitalizations and 90 of flurelated  deaths occur in people 65 years and older  This data confirms that the 2009 H1N1  impacted younger adults and children more than older adults compared to  seasonal flu  However people in all age  groups can develop severe illness from either seasonal flu or from 2009 H1N1  Flu season seems to be dying down Why do people still need a vaccination against 2009 H1N1  The flu season is not over yet  As recently as January 15 7 states were still reporting regional flu activity so flu is still out there  Also seasonal flu typically peaks in February and March and influenza activity can occur as late as May  So increased activity from either seasonal flu 2009 H1N1 or both are still possible this season For example during the 195758 pandemic flu activity dropped in December and January  Public health officials assumed the worst was over and stopped encouraging people to get vaccinated  Then flu activity increased abruptly in February and March and hospitalizations and deaths increased as well  That was an important lesson even if flu activity dies down in January as it has this year the season is not over  It s still important to get vaccinated against the flu and be as prepared as possible if activity increases again this season  Is there anyone who should take priority when it comes to getting a flu vaccination  Right now there is enough vaccine for everyone who hasn t been vaccinated and wants to be Children who are 9years old or younger need two doses of vaccine about a month apart  There is enough vaccine for them as well  But it is especially important for certain groups of people to get vaccinated  If you have certain underlying health conditions such as asthma heart disease or diabetes or if you re pregnant you re at greater risk of complications from flu  If you re over 65 you re also at risk of complications  If you re a health care worker you should get vaccinated  If you care for or live with an infant under 6 months of age babies less than 6 months old are too young to be vaccinated you should get vaccinated too to prevent spreading the flu to people who are vulnerable  Where should I go to get vaccinated against 2009 H1N1  This is a very good time to get vaccinated  Right now not many people are sick and there is enough vaccine for everyone who hasn t been vaccinated yet including kids 9 years old and younger who need a second dose  An easy way to find out where vaccine is available in your area is by going to wwwflugov and clicking on the vaccine locator  In addition Flugov has a new Facebook application the  Flu Fighter   It s one of the site s many  viral  communication tools to help spread the word that getting a vaccine against 2009 H1N1 is the best way to protect yourself and your friends  When you go to flugov please check it out   If the second dose of 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine for children under 10 years of age is given over a month after the first dose is it still considered effective  Yes CDC recommends that the two doses of vaccine against 2009 H1N1 influenza virus be separated by 4 weeks However if the second dose is separated from the first dose by at least 21 days the second dose can be considered valid    Supply and Distribution  How do project areas know how much vaccine is available for them to order  CDC distributes vaccine to 62 project areas  These project areas include 50 states the District of Columbia 8 US territories and freely associated states and 3 large metropolitan areas  CDC sends these project areas an allocation report each morning on how much of each formulation of vaccine against 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is available for them to order  What is the number of doses  allocated  for ordering  The number of doses allocated for ordering is the amount that is at the distribution depots and ready for states to order The quantity of vaccine allocated is based on the project areas population size As an example if 6 million doses total 3 million doses of nasal spray vaccine AND 3 million doses of injectable vaccine are ready for ordering nationally as of today and a state has 10 of the US population then their allocation for today is 600000 doses total 300000 doses of the nasal spray vaccine and 300000 doses of injectable vaccine  How is vaccine shipped to project areas  CDC s contractor for centralized distribution ships vaccine directly to hospitals clinics doctor s offices health departments and other providers of vaccines that have been designated by the project area  What kind of providers can be designated by project areas to receive vaccine  Project areas are responsible for registering vaccine providers in their jurisdiction  Providers may include but are not limited to individual clinicians provider offices clinics at places of work hospitals local health departments retail pharmacies and community vaccinators  Providers or facilities receiving vaccine must be capable of receiving and properly storing vaccine  What is the number of doses  allocated  for ordering  The number of doses  allocated for ordering is the amount that is at the distribution  depots and ready for states to order The quantity of vaccine allocated is  based on the project areas population size As an example if 6 million doses  total 3 million doses of nasal spray vaccine AND 3 million doses of injectable  vaccine are ready for ordering nationally and a state has 10 of the US  population then their allocation for today is 600000 doses total 300000  doses of the nasal spray vaccine and 300000 doses of injectable vaccine  Who determines which providers receive the vaccine  Specific determinations about where vaccine will be shipped and how it will be distributed to providers are made at the state and local level  The federal government allocates vaccine based on population to public health departments in the 62 project areas These public health departments then make decisions about how to distribute vaccine to providers equitably and efficiently within their jurisdictions with the goal of reaching the priority groups first  State and local immunization programs have planned their efforts according to local capacity and needs CDC continues to encourage state and local health officials to review and revise their vaccine distribution plans in response to changing needs  How does CDC ensure that providers  vaccination practices are consistent with ACIP recommendations  Providers who offer the vaccine against 2009 H1N1 influenza virus must sign an agreement stating that they will adhere to recommendations issued by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP  How many sites can a project area designate to receive vaccine  There is a maximum of 150000 sites to which vaccine can be shipped via the centralized distribution system Project areas have received information about their allocation of sites  What should project areas expect with respect to frequency of vaccine shipments  Vaccine is shipped as it becomes available taking into account state allocations and orders The process is modeled after that utilized by immunization programs to order seasonal influenza vaccine off the federal contract Details about CDCs orderingallocation process for seasonal influenza are described in the allgrantee message sent to immunization program grantees on August 11 2009 Grantee message for allocation  What is the minimum dose  order for shipments of 2009 H1N1 vaccine  For each vaccine formulation identified by its National Drug Code the minimum dose order is 100 doses and all orders must be placed in increments of 100 doses Each ancillary supply kit contains supplies to support 100 doses of vaccine with different kits available for prefilled syringe products and for multidose vial products  When was the vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 virus first available and how much was available  Both the injected vaccine flu shot and nasal spray forms of the vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 virus were produced and licensed by the Food and Drug Administration The vaccine first became available in early October and more doses are becoming available every week Vaccine availability however depends on many factors so these numbers are updated often The first doses of the nasal spray or live attenuated intranasal vaccine LAIV were administered on October 5 2009 and the first doses of the influenza shot were administered the week of October 12  Where is the vaccine available  Every state has developed a vaccine delivery plan Vaccine has been available in a combination of settings such as vaccination clinics organized by local health departments healthcare provider offices schools and other private settings such as pharmacies and workplaces For more information see StateJurisdiction Contact Information for Health Care Providers Interested in Providing H1N1 Vaccine   For information on seasonal vaccine supply and distribution visit Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Supply for the US 20092010 Influenza Season   Can I get vaccinated against the 2009 H1N1 virus at my workplace  CDC has recommended that when possible worksites offer both influenza vaccines It also suggests that workplaces consider granting employees time off from work to get vaccinated if not offered at the worksite For more information on CDC s influenza guidance for businesses and employers visit CDC Guidance for Businesses and Employers To Plan and Respond to the 2009 2010 Influenza Season    Vaccines for the 20092010 Influenza Season  Does the seasonal influenza vaccine also protect against 2009 H1N1 influenza  The seasonal influenza vaccine will not protect you against 2009 H1N1 influenza For more information about the seasonal flu vaccine read Key Facts About Seasonal Flu Vaccine   Is this vaccine made differently than the seasonal influenza vaccine  No The vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 virus is made using the same processes and facilities that are used to make the currently licensed seasonal influenza vaccines  Can both flu vaccines be given at the same time  Inactivated vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 flu virus  the flu shot can be given at the same visit as any other vaccine including pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine The LAIV nasal spray vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 virus can be administered at the same visit as any other live or inactivated vaccine EXCEPT seasonal live attenuated influenza vaccine  Prior Vaccination or Illness  Should I get vaccinated against 2009 H1N1 if I have had flulike illness since the Spring of 2009  The symptoms of influenza flulike  illnesses are similar to those caused by many other viruses Even when  influenza viruses are causing large numbers of people to get sick other  viruses are also causing illnesses Specific testing called  RTPCR test  is  needed in order to tell if an illness is caused by a specific influenza strain  or by some other virus This test is different from rapid flu tests that  doctors can do in their offices Since most people with flulike illnesses will  not be tested with RTPCR this season the majority will not know whether they  have been infected with 2009 H1N1 flu or a different virus  Therefore if you were ill but do not  know if you had 2009 H1N1 infection you should get vaccinated if your doctor  recommends it So most people recommended for 2009 H1N1 vaccination should be  vaccinated with the 2009 H1N1 vaccine regardless of whether they had a flulike  illness earlier in the year If you have had 2009 H1N1 flu as confirmed by an  RTPCR test you should have some immunity against 2009 H1N1 flu and can choose  not to get the 2009 H1N1 vaccine However vaccination of a person with some  existing immunity to the 2009 H1N1 virus will not be harmful For more  information on flu tests see Influenza Diagnostic Testing During the 20092010 Flu  Season   Any immunity from 2009 H1N1 influenza  infection or vaccination will not provide protection against seasonal  influenza All people who want protection from seasonal flu should still get  their seasonal influenza vaccine  Prevention  Are there other ways to prevent the spread of illness  Take everyday actions to stay healthy   Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it  Wash your hands often with soap and water especially after you cough or sneeze If soap and water are not available use an alcoholbased hand rub   Avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth Germs spread that way   Stay home if you get sick CDC recommends that you stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from infecting them CDC recommends that people with influenzalike illness remain at home until at least 24 hours after they are free of fever temperature of 100 F 378C or more or signs of a fever without the use of feverreducing medications  Follow public health advice regarding school closures avoiding crowds and other social distancing measures These measures are still important even with the availability of the vaccine against 2009 H1N1 virus because they can prevent the spread of other viruses that cause respiratory infections  What about the use of antivirals to treat 2009 H1N1 infection  CDC has issued interim guidance for the use of antiviral drugs for this season CDC also has published Questions  Answers related to the use of antiviral drugs for this season  Are natural remedies also referred to as  complementary  or alternative medicine recommended to prevent the 2009 H1N1 Influenza virus  The first and most important step to prevent influenza is to get vaccinated Vaccination stimulates an immune response using a killed or weakened virus that uses the body s own defense mechanisms to prevent infection CDCs current recommendations to protect against 2009 H1N1 virus do not include natural remedies as a sole prevention method If you want to use a natural remedy to reduce symptoms CDC recommends that you talk to your health care provider about options  Alternative medicine should not be used as a replacement for proven conventional care or to postpone seeing a doctor about a medical problem The National Institutes of Health NIH provides information on specific alternative options including scientific information potential side effects and cautions for each  The Federal Trade Commission FTC warns consumers to be cautious about products that claim to prevent treat or cure 2009 H1N1 influenza specifically products like pills air filtration devices and cleaning agents can kill or eliminate the virus                 Print page     Subscribe to RSS  Follow on Twitter  Podcasts           Get email updates  To receive weekly email updates about this

the article   June 2012    Pigs can have more than one type of flu at the same time This means that viruses can mix genes and become a type of flu that could cause a pandemic  Swine influenza virus is a virus that is common in pigs  This type of influenza virus can also infect humans and birds Swine influenza virus is sometimes called SIV or swine flu  Swine flu is common in pigs Normally it only infects people who have been in close contact with pigs However the disease has also spread from one person to another 1 Swine flu can cause fever  disorientation not being clearheaded stiffness of the joints vomiting  and loss of consciousness  Sometimes this ends in death 2 There are different types or strains of swine flu They are called H1N1  3  H1N2  3  H3N1  4  H3N2  3 and H2N3  5

   Background  change  change source    Military hospital during Spanish flu pandemic in 1918  H1N1 came from the Spanish flu  which caused a pandemic in humans in 1918 and 1919 6 7 New viruses came from the Spanish flu These viruses became common in pigs Every once in a while the viruses spread from pigs to humans This has happened during the 20th century However they happened at the same time as the flu epidemics that happen every year Because of this it is hard to tell the difference between normal influenza and swine influenza 6 Infections that spread from pigs to humans are rare Scientists only know of 12 known cases in the United States since 2005 8  It is very difficult to prevent the flu virus This is because the virus changes all the time If a person gets the flu his body forms antibodies to fight that virus off if it happens again But since the flu virus changes all the time a persons antibodies do not recognize the virus the next time it happens because it is different The same thing happens with vaccines  The changes in the flu virus can cause a flu pandemic  For example the virus might only change a little bit in about two to three years After about ten years most people will have developed antibodies to fight these small changes But if the virus then changes a lot there can be a pandemic Hundreds of millions of people suddenly realize that the antibodies they developed are useless 9 Even during the Spanish flu pandemic the first wave of the disease was relatively mild while the second wave was very deadly 7  In 1957 an Asian flu pandemic infected about 45 million Americans and killed 70000 Eleven years later from 1968 to 1969 the Hong Kong flu pandemic infected 50 million Americans and caused 33000 deaths It also cost about 39 billion In 1976 about 500 soldiers became infected with swine flu over a few weeks However by the end of the month investigators found that the virus had mysteriously disappeared and there were no more signs of swine flu anywhere on the post 7 There were a small number of isolated farapart cases around the US However these were in people who were thought to have caught the virus from pigs Scientists fear the swine flu virus might mutate  or change into a pandemic as deadly as the 19181919 pandemic They watched the outbreak in 2009 and made plans about what to do if a global pandemic breaks out  Symptoms  change  change source   The main symptoms of the swine influenza is much the same as regular influenza  Symptoms include vomiting  nausea  runny nose  loss of appetite lethargy feeling tired chills  fever  body aches  sore throat  coughing  diarrhea  and stomach ache   Where swine influenza is found  change  change source   The bird flu virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China  It has recently been found in pigs in Vietnam  Specialists also think that this might lead to new variations of the influenza virus 10 Pigs can carry human influenza viruses These viruses can combine in new ways and exchange certain genes with H5N1  Through mutation  this would create a form of the virus that can pass easily among humans 11  H3N2 evolved from H2N2 by antigenic shift  12 In August 2004 researchers in China found H5N1 in pigs 13  In 2005 it was discovered that H5N1 could be infecting up to half of the pig population in some areas of Indonesia  but without showing symptoms  Chairul Nidom a virologist at Airlangga University s tropical disease center in Surabaya  East Java  did some independent  research  he tested the blood of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in West Java where avian flu had broken out Nature reported Five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus The Indonesian government has since found similar results in the same region Additional tests of 150 pigs outside the area were negative 14 15   Swine Flu in Humans  change  change source    Electron microscope image of the N1H1 virus The viruses are 80120 nanometres in diameter 16  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC a United States government agency reports that the symptoms and transmission of the swine flu from human to human is much like seasonal flu Usually the symptoms are fever  lethargy feeling tired lack of appetite and coughing  Some people with swine flu also have reported runny nose  sore throat  nausea  vomiting and diarrhoea  17 It is believed to be spread between humans when an infected person coughs or sneezes and then touches something Another person then might touch the same thing with the virus on it and then touch their own nose or mouth 18 The swine flu in humans is most contagious during the first five days of the illness although some people most commonly children can be contagious for up to ten days  Diagnosis can be made by sending a specimen sample collected during the first five days to the CDC for analysis 19  The Swine Flu is susceptible to four licensed drugs in the United States amantadine  rimantadine  oseltamivir and zanamivir  However for the 2009 outbreak it is recommended it be treated with oseltamivir and zanamivir 20 The vaccine for the human seasonal flu does not protect against the swine flu Even if the virus strains are the same specific variety the antigenicity is very different 21    Veterinary swine flu vaccine  change  change source   The virus has evolved in recent decades This has made Swine influenza a bigger problem mainly because traditional vaccines against influenza do not always work against Swine influenza There are special vaccines against Swine influenza but they only work if the virus strain is similar to some extent In the cases more difficult to treat special vaccines are produced These are very similar as they are made to match the specific virus strain 22 23  Present vaccination strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined only 41 isolates had strong serologic crossreactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests that current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses 24 25  The current vaccine against the seasonal influenza strain H1N1 is thought unlikely to provide protection 26 The director of CDCs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said that the United States cases were found to be made up of genetic elements from four different flu virusesNorth American swine influenza North American avian influenza human influenza A virus subtype H1N1  and swine influenza virus typically found in Asia and Europe  On two cases a complete genome sequence had been obtained  She said that the virus is resistant to amantadine and rimantadine  but susceptible to oseltamivir Tamiflu and zanamivir Relenza 27 28 29   2009 outbreak  change  change source     Confirmed cases people died  Confirmed cases no deaths  Unconfirmed or suspected cases  A new strain of swine influenza A called H1N1 was responsible for the swine flu outbreak in 2009 in humans It resulted from a combination of several strains of influenza in humans and influenza in birds as well as swine influenza Tests were done they found that the hemagglutinin HA gene was similar to that of swine flu viruses present in United States pigs since 1999 but the neuraminidase NA and matrix protein M genes resembled versions present in European swine Viruses that were built like this had not been found in humans or pigs before There is no program to monitor what viruses are circulating in pigs in the United States however 30   Related pages  change  change source   Avian influenza  Pandemic  List of epidemics  Infectious disease

people rushing to doctors for vaccination but experts suggest they should calm down instead because the outbreak has almost run its course making the vaccine almost redundant  TNN  Updated Mar 5 2015 0512 IST PUNE The spurt in swine flu cases has people rushing to doctors for vaccination but experts suggest they should calm down instead because the outbreak has almost run its course making the vaccine almost redundant  Not everybody needs to take a swine flu vaccine People in highrisk categories and children below five can take the shot said Mandeep Chadha who heads the influenza research group at National Institute of Virology NIV  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDCC Atlanta a USbased public health institute recommends vaccination for children between 4 months and 5 years those above 50 years people suffering from chronic respiratory cardiovascular problems diabetes pregnant women and health workers  Chadha said A vaccineinduced immunity lasts for eight to 12 months Taking a flu shot in May is more advisable as it will cover two periods of heightened influenza activity which is seen in JulyAugust during monsoon and DecemberJanuary during winter  Physician Shyam Kagal said The current swine flu outbreak has almost run its course and there is no point in taking a vaccine now as it will take two to three weeks to develop immunity and by that time the influenza will subside  A swine flu vaccine does not give 100 protection said physician Narendra Javdekar He said people can ward off the infection by simply taking basic precautions Not everyone needs to go for the vaccine Only people in highrisk category should take it said Javdekar  K Anil Roy medical officer of health MoH Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation PCMC said The efficacy of the swine flu vaccine is between 60 and 80 and it takes about three weeks for the immunity to develop Besides taking a shot made especially of live attenuated virus in the middle of an outbreak is not advisable simply because such a vaccine can flare up the infection if it is given to a person who is already exposed to the virus but is not symptomatic  However some experts disagree Prasad Kulkarni medical director of the Serum Institute of India SII said We live in a tropical region which sees very irregular influenza activity so we cannot firmly say how long the current outbreak situation will last The efficacy of swine flu vaccine is about 80 but even then it is advisable because it lends protection to the vaccinated population from a potentially fatal disease  Kulkarni said that the Serums trivalent influenza vaccine which lends protection against swine flu H3N2 and influenza B virus will be available by Marchend  Senior paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar who is the vicepresident of the Indian Medical Association IMA too stressed on vaccination mainly for people in highrisk categories and children below the age of five He also disagreed with Roys observation and said that vaccinating a subclinically infected person not showing symptoms would not aggravate the infection but he may develop mild symptoms post vaccination The flare up of infection occurs only when a person is given a steroid or immunosuppressantThe suppressed immunity of a person will be conducive for the multiplication of virus In a case of live attenuated vaccine there is a potential risk of virus multiplication in an immunocompromised patient he said  Agarkhedkar has played a role in swine flu vaccine trials in Pune   Vaccine for whom   Not everybody   Those in highrisk categories and children below 5 yrs of age   Trivalent influenza vaccine lends protection against swine flu H3N2 and influenza B viruses   Diabetics people above 60 posttransplant patients kidney patients pregnant and

know about swine flu     Last updated Tue 16 May 2017   Last updated			Tue 16 May 2017    By Christian Nordqvist    Reviewed by Jill SeladiSchulman PhD       Table of contents  Symptoms  Vaccine  Treatment  Causes  Diagnosis  Home remedies  Facts    Swine flu is a disease of pigs that can in rare cases be passed to humans It is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by one of many Influenza A viruses The disease is spread among pigs by direct and indirect contact aerosols and from pigs that are infected but do not have symptoms In many parts of the world pigs are vaccinated against swine flu   Most commonly swine flu is of the H1N1 influenza subtype However swine flu viruses can sometimes come from other subtypes such as H1N2 H3N1 and H3N2  The 2009 outbreak of swine flu that infected humans was of the H1N1 subtype It is important to note that although it developed in swine the 2009 pandemic virus was not completely derived from swine The virus contains a combination of flu genes from bird swine and human flu types   Fast facts on swine flu  Here are some key points about swine flu   Swine flu was normally of the H1N1 influenza subtype However since 2017 the H3N2 subtype has become the dominant strain  The most common way for a human to catch swine flu is through contact with a pig  There is currently a vaccine for swine flu that is included with the standard seasonal flu shots  Symptoms of swine flu include coughs chills and aches similar to seasonal flu      Symptoms   Swine flu is spread to humans primarily through contact with infected pigs   The symptoms of swine flu in humans are quite similar to those of regular flu and include   body aches  chills  cough  headache  sore throat  fever  tiredness   Less commonly a person with swine flu may experience vomiting and diarrhea  Symptoms can be managed with similar treatments to regular flu However a doctor should examine the patient for confirmation of swine flu and advise how to relief individual symptoms   Vaccine  A vaccine has been produced to protect humans against the H1N1 strain of swine flu This was introduced following a pandemic of swine flu in 2009 and 2010  The status of swine flu has changed from a pandemic to a seasonal type of human influenza The specialized vaccine has now been replaced by more general seasonal flu shots   People who are over 10 years old only require one shot of the vaccine The US Food and Drug Administration FDA recommends two shots for children under this age to be taken four weeks apart  People with an egg allergy and children with severe asthma are at risk of an adverse reaction to this vaccine and should discuss the shot with a healthcare professional There are special regimens designed to help the bodies of people who experience these reactions accept the vaccine              Treatment  There are some drugs available that can effectively treat swine flu  The two main treatments are adamantanes including amantadine and rimantadine and medications that inhibit the influenza neuraminidase protein such as oseltamivir and zanamivir  However most people with swine influenza recover completely without the need for medical attention   Causes  There are only a few causes of swine flu in humans They are  Contact with infected pigs This is the most common way of catching swine flu Any contact with infected pigs makes transmission more likely  Contact with infected humans This is a much less common way of catching swine flu but is a risk especially for those in close contact with an infected person  In cases where humans have infected other humans close contact was necessary with the infected person and it nearly always occurred in closed groups of people  Risk factors  Some people are more at risk of catching swine flu than others including   people aged over 65 years  children under 5 years  people with chronic diseases  pregnant women  teenagers receiving longterm aspirin therapy  anyone with a compromised immune system     Diagnosis  Swine flu is mostly diagnosed through noting the symptoms  There is also a quick test called the rapid influenza diagnostic test that can help identify swine flu However these vary in effectiveness and may show a negative result even though influenza is present More accurate tests are available in more specialized laboratories  However in a similar way to seasonal flu symptoms are often mild and selfresolve Most people do not receive a test for swine flu as treatment would be the same regardless of the outcome  If symptoms are mild it is extremely unlikely that any connection to swine influenza is found even if the virus is there             Home remedies  As there is no known single cure steps can be taken at home to prevent swine flu and reduce symptoms if a person does contract the virus  These include   washing hands regularly with soap  getting plenty of sleep  exercising often  managing stress   drinking liquids  eating a balanced diet  refraining from touching surfaces that may have the virus   Do not get close to people who are sick Be sure to stay away from crowds if there is a swine flu outbreak in your area  How to reduce the spread of infection  If a person is infected it is important they follow these rules to prevent any further spread   Limit contact with other people  Do not go to work or school  When coughing or sneezing cover the mouth with a tissue If there is no tissue available cover the mouth and nose  Put used tissues in a trash can  Wash the hands and face regularly  Keep all surfaces that are touched clean  Follow all doctors instructions    Facts   It is still perfectly safe to eat pork products so long as they are cooked properly    Viruses from pigs do occasionally cause outbreaks of human infection  Because swine flu symptoms are similar to those of seasonal flu swine flu in humans is often not detected If it is found it is normally during seasonal influenza surveillance  Examples of swine flu infecting humans  Since the World Health Organizations WHOs implementation of IHR 2005 in 2007 they have been notified of swine influenza cases from the United States and Spain In March to April 2009 human cases of influenza A swine fever H1N1 were first reported in California and Texas  Other states also reported cases later on A significant number of human cases during the same period were also reported in Mexico  starting just in Mexico City but then throughout various parts of the country  More cases are being reported in Canada Europe and New Zealand mainly from people who have been in Mexico  Can I eat pork meat and pork products  If pork meat and pork food products have been handled properly transmission of swine influenza to humans is not possible Cooking pork meats to a temperature of 160F 70C kills the virus  Pork meat and pork food products are safe to eat  Where have pigs been infected with swine flu  As swine influenza infection among pigs is not an internationally notifiable disease it is not completely clear Swine influenza infection among pigs is known to be endemic to the US  Outbreaks have also occurred in other parts of North America South American Europe Africa China Japan and other parts of Asia  Is there the risk of another pandemic  People who are not in close contact with pigs generally have no immunity to the swine influenza viruses They are less likely to be able to prevent a viral infection If the virus infects enough people in a given area the risk of an influenza pandemic is significantly greater  It is very hard to predict what impact another swine flu pandemic would have on the global human population This would depend on how aggressive the virus is the existing immunity among humans the strain behind the pandemic and a number of other factors  Will current vaccines work against swine flu  Swine flu is now included in the seasonal flu shots  Influenza viruses adapt and change all the time The WHO says it needs access to as many viruses as possible so that it can isolate the most appropriate candidate for a vaccine  Current vaccines are effective against many strains of swine flu            Related

httpswwwnaturalnewscom051622swinefluvaccinebraindamageGlaxoSmithKlinehtml  Tweet                 NaturalNews As advocates for mandatory vaccination spread propaganda across the United States the British government is dealing with the fallout of a faulty swine flu vaccine that has caused numerous cases of brain damage in children As reported by the International Business Times  the UK government is financially compensating at least 60 families in a multimillionpound settlement that is likely to grow as more patients suffer physical harm from the vaccine The government is expected to receive a bill of approximately 60 million 901 million with each of the 60 victims expected to receive about 1 million 15 million each IBT reported In an interview with The Sunday Times  attorney Peter Todd who is representing a number of victims said There has never been a case like this before The victims of this vaccine have an incurable and lifelong condition and will require extensive medication Following an outbreak of swine flu in 2009 some 60 million people received vaccines most of them children Health officials investigating the subsequent illnesses found that the vaccine Pandemrix can cause narcolepsy and cataplexy in about one in 16000 people many more are likely to come forward with symptoms IBT reported Stay up to date on vaccine news at Vaccinesnews 80 percent of victims are children Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder that causes overwhelming daytime drowsiness sometimes people with the condition can appear to fall asleep instantly Narcolepsy affects a persons sleeping cycle leaving them unable to sleep for more than 90 minutes at a time and causing them to fall unconscious during the day IBT reported The condition damages mental function and memory and can lead to hallucinations and mental illness Cataplexy meanwhile is an abrupt temporary loss of voluntary muscular function and tone evoked by an emotional stimulus such as laughter pleasure anger or excitement according to this definition from the National NiemannPick Disease Foundation The stimulation leads to a very rapid loss of voluntary muscle control  often the person will immediately collapse as a result The collapse occurs because the person can no longer control their leg muscles to remain standing The person regains control of muscle tone slowly when the stimulation eases As further reported by IBT all across Europe more than 800 children thus far are known to have been sickened by the vaccine Pandemrix was manufactured by Big Pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline  incredibly the company refused to provide the vaccine to governments until they agreed to indemnify GSK against any damage claims As for the vaccine injuries caused by Pandemix GSK will pay the initial claims but then bill the UK government for whatever the vaccine maker pays out Theres no doubt in my mind whatsoever that Pandemrix increased the occurrence of narcolepsy onset in children in some countries  and probably in most countries Emmanuelle Mignot a specialist in sleep disorder at Stanford University in the United States told Reuters according to IBT Mignot was hired by GSK to study the effects of Pandemrix Vaccine maker refuses to acknowledge there is a problem But the injections have not just sickened children it has also caused problems among Britains National Health Service staff leaving many unable to perform their jobs because of symptoms brought on by the vaccine IBT reported that these employees will be suing the UK government to recover their lost wages Still the vast majority of patients sickened by the vaccine are children  around 80 percent One child injured by the vaccine is Josh Hadfield an 8yearold boy from Somerset His parents say he is now on antinarcolepsy drugs that cost 15000 more than 22500 a year just to help him remain awake during his school day If you make him laugh he collapses His memory is shot There is no cure He says he wishes he hadnt been born I feel incredibly guilty about letting him have the vaccine his mother Caroline Hadfield 43 told IBT Again incredibly the vaccine was given despite a warning from the European Medicines Agency in 2011 in which officials advised it not be used on anyone under 20 years old The agency cited a study in which researchers found a 13fold increase in the risk of narcolepsy in children vaccinated with the drug Despite that GSK has steadfastly refused to acknowledge the link Sources httpwwwibtimescouk httpwwwnnpdforg httpwwwnaturalnewscom         Search on GoodGophercom

  Back to Health AZ         Swine flu H1N1     Swine flu was the popular name for flu caused by a relatively new type of flu virus responsible for a global flu outbreak or pandemic in 200910 Its now just a normal type of seasonal flu and is included in the annual flu vaccine  The scientific name for the swine flu virus is AH1N1pdm09  sometimes shortened to H1N1    Swine flu pandemic 200910  The virus was first identified in Mexico in April 2009 It became known as swine flu because its similar to flu viruses that affect pigs  It spread rapidly from country to country because it was a new type of flu virus that few young people were immune to  Overall the outbreak wasnt as serious as originally predicted largely because many older people were already immune to it Most cases in the UK were relatively mild  although serious cases still occurred  The relatively small number of cases resulting in serious illness and death were mostly in younger adults and children  particularly those with underlying health problems  and pregnant women  On August 10 2010 the World Health Organization WHO declared the pandemic officially over    Swine flu now  The AH1N1pdm09 virus is now one of the seasonal flu viruses that circulate each winter If youve had flu in the last few years theres a chance it was caused by this virus  As many people now have some level of immunity to the AH1N1pdm09 virus its much less of a concern than in 200910  The symptoms are the same as normal flu  theyre usually mild and pass within a week or so But as with all types of flu some people  particularly those with underlying health problems  are at higher risk of serious illness  The regular flu vaccine will normally protect people at a higher risk of becoming severely ill A new childrens vaccine programme is also being introduced which aims to protect children and reduce their ability to infect others  Read more about  Symptoms of flu  Treatment for flu  Preventing flu  Annual flu jab  Flu vaccine for

Images Are the rising swine flu casualties giving you jitters Not sure how you can avoid falling prey to the growing epidemic First and foremost there is absolutely no need to panic  Here are some easy steps you can take to tackle a flu virus of any kind including swine flu It is not necessary to follow all the steps at once You can pick and choose a combination of remedies that suit you best However if you are already suffering from flu these measures can help only up to an extent  1 Have five duly washed leaves of Tulsi known as Basil in English medicinal name Ocimum sanctum everyday in the morning Tulsi has a large number of therapeutic properties It keeps throat and lungs clear and helps in infections by way of strengthening your immunity  2 Giloi medicinal name Tinospora cordifolia is a commonly available plant in many areas Take a onefoot long branch of giloi add five to six leaves of Tulsi and boil in water for 1520 minutes or long enough to allow the water to extract its properties Add black pepper and sendha salt used during religious fasts rock or black salt or Misri crystalised sugar like lumps to make it sweet according to taste Let it cool a bit and drink this kadha concoction while still warm It will work wonders for your immunity If giloi plant is not available get processed giloi powder from Hamdard or others and concoct a similar drink once a day  3 A small piece of camphor kapoor approximately the size of a tablet should be taken once or twice a month It can be swallowed with water by adults while children can take it along with mashed potatoes or banana because they will find it difficult to have it without any aides Please remember camphor is not to be taken everyday but only once each season or once a month  4 Those who can take garlic must have two pods of raw garlic first thing in the morning To be swallowed daily with lukewarm water Garlic too strengthens immunity like the earlier measures mentioned  5 Those not allergic to milk must take a glass of hot or lukewarm milk every night with a small measure of haldi turmeric  6 Aloe vera gwarpatha too is a commonly available plant Its thick and long cactuslike leaves have an odourless gel A teaspoon gel taken with water daily can work wonders for not only your skin and joint pains but also boost immunity  7 Take homeopathic medicines  Pyrogenium 200 and Inflenzium 200 in particular  five tablets three times a day or twothree drops three times a day While these are not specifically targeted at H1N1 either these work well as preventive against common flu virus  8 Do Pranayam daily preferably under guidance if you are already not initiated into it and go for morning jogwalk regularly to keep your throat and lungs in good condition and body in fine fettle Even in small measures it will work wonders for your bodys resistance against all such diseases which attack the nose throat and lungs besides keeping you fit  9 Have citrus fruits particularly Vitamin C rich Amla Indian gooseberry juice Since fresh Amla is not yet available in the market not for another three to four months it is not a bad idea to buy packaged Amla juice which is commonly available nowadays  10 Last but not the least wash your hands frequently every day with soap and warm water for 1520 seconds especially before meals or each time after touching a surface that you suspect could be contaminated with flu virus such as a door handle or a knobhandle especially if you have returned from a public place or used public transport Alcoholbased hand cleaners should be kept handy at all times and used until you can get soap and warm water  The author is an avid reader and follower of alternative therapies including spiritual healing ayurveda yoga and homeopathy     End of the article

Pasteur  MedImmune and Novartis   How are the H1N1 vaccines manufactured and are they safe  The H1N1 vaccines are manufactured using the same vaccine 
manufacturing processes used for the regular seasonal flu vaccines and the H1N1 
vaccines should be as safe and as effective as the regular seasonal flu 
vaccines  What are the differences between the H1N1 and regular flu vaccine  The difference between regular flu vaccines and H1N1 vaccines is the virus that is used in the manufacturing process Regular flu 
vaccine does not contain components of the 2009 H1N1 virus  Regular flu vaccines do not protect against H1N1 and H1N1 vaccines will not protect against the 
regular flu  Who should receive H1N1 flu vaccine  The following groups should receive H1N1 vaccine as soon as possible   Pregnant women because they are more likely to develop serious illness and death from H1N1  People who live with or care for infants younger than 6 months of age in order to prevent transmission of flu

respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza virus that regularly causes outbreaks of influenza in pigs Swine influenza viruses may circulate among swine throughout the year but most outbreaks occur during the late fall and winter months similar to outbreaks of flu in humans The classical swine flu virus an influenza type A H1N1 virus was first isolated from a pig in 1930  People usually do not get swine flu though there have been a few cases reported in persons working in close proximity with pigs Since the virus from the pigs has to mutate so it can infect humans and because people do not usually contract the virus they have no immunity against it So when they do contract it it can become hazardous  The current 2009 swine flu outbreak is due to a new strain of the virus which is a reassortment of different strains endemic in humans birds and swine This new strain was not reported in pigs previously and is sub typed as H1N1 though other subtypes exist It is contagious and spreads from humantohuman contact  2 How do symptoms of swine flu differ from other types of flu  Not much The basic symptoms for swine flu are similar to the seasonal flu which may include fever sore throat cough stuffy nose chills headache and body aches and fatigue and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea  3 How does it spread  The virus is actually transmitted by airborne droplets from an infected persons sneeze or cough or from germs on hands  4 Is there medication or a vaccine for swine flu  The vaccine is being developed and will not be available for the next several months Medications are available not only to treat the infection but also to prevent the disease But these medications need to be used under a physicians guidance  5 How can human infections with swine influenza be diagnosed  To diagnose swine influenza A infection a respiratory specimen would need to be collected within the first 4 to 5 days of illness when an infected person is most likely to be shedding virus However some persons especially children may shed virus for 7 days or longer  6 What can I do to prevent infection   Avoid contact with people who are sick  Wash your hands frequently with soap and water  Try to stay in good health and be physically active  Cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough  Stay at home if you are ill  If you develop symptoms suggesting the flu stay away from work or public transportation call and see a doctor immediately   7 Is there confirmation of transmission between pigs and humans  No  8 Is it safe to eat pork and pork products  Yes The virus is killed by cooking temperatures of 160 F 70C  9 Are some people more at risk  More data is needed regarding this but in general younger people older people people who are immunocompromised and pregnant women are more vulnerable  10 Is it safe to travel  As of now there are no travel restrictions Limiting travel would have little effect on stopping the virus from spreading but would be highly disruptive to the global community The focus now is on minimizing the impact of the virus  A Lowdown on the Swine Flu Alert  The current swine flu alert sweeping across the globe has health organizations doing their best to prevent a fullblown pandemic The challenge for them is to prevent the virus from crossing borders and infecting other populations So what exactly is swine flu  Swine flu is a form of influenza that is caused by strains of virus that usually infects pigs Its a common infection  A Lowdown on the Swine Flu Alert among pigs in Midwestern US Mexico Canada South America Europe Kenya Mainland China Taiwan Japan and other parts of Asia  Transmission of the swine flu virus from pigs to humans is not common though there have been some reported cases earlier among people who work in close proximity with pigs Since the midtwentieth century only about fifty such transmissions have been reported the spread and disappearance being more localized  But the current strain of the microbe is resilient and fastmoving and whats even more worrying is that it spreads from humantohuman contact unlike the earlier reported cases This means that none of us are immune to the possibility of infection  Reports indicate that the current strain is a new one of influenza A virus subtype H1N1 The origin of this strain is unknown World Organization of animal health reports that this strain is not isolated in pigs and other initial  Besides antivirals palliative care focused on controlling fevers and maintaining fluid balance goes a long way to ensure recovery In fact the majority of people infected with swine flu make a full recovery without requiring medical intervention or antiviral drugs  reports describe it as an apparent reassortment of at least four strains from humans birds and swine  Diagnosis  Since symptoms mimic those for common flu for a layperson it is hard to tell them apart Medically the virus is diagnosed by 1 Throat nasopharyngeal swab and 2 blood samples for the antibodies  Treatment  If diagnosed early swine flu is easy to treat so there is no need for panic The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO recommend the use of Tamiflu oseltamivir or Relenza zanamivir for treating swine flu Besides antivirals palliative care focused on controlling fevers and maintaining fluid balance goes a long way to ensure recovery In fact the majority of people infected with swine flu make a full recovery without requiring medical intervention or antiviral drugs  Prevention  A new vaccine being developed is slated to be available only mid2009 Till then adequate precautions against infection is absolutely essential in order to prevent a global pandemic Prevention has three components 1 Prevention in swine 2 Prevention of transmission to humans and 3 Prevention of it spreading among humans  Prevention in Swine   Facility management  Herd management  Vaccination   Prevention of Transmission to Humans   Farmers working with pigs and veterinarians must use a face mask when dealing with infected animals   Wearing gloves when working with sick animals  Prevention of Human to Human Transmission   Frequent washing of hands with soap and water or with alcoholbased hand sensitizers especially after being out in the public  Anyone with flulike symptoms such as sudden fever cough or muscle aches should stay away from work or public transportation and contact a doctor to be tested          Google Map Location               Value added service     Consult Doctors Online    Book Physical Appointment    View Health

  Beforehand           1   Know the Dangers of getting the Swine Flu  This is the first and most important step to getting the vaccine  Most individuals develop typical symptoms of the flu including  Fever  Sore throat  Cough  Headache  Muscle or joint pains  Nausea vomiting or diarrhea    However individuals with certain conditions such as asthma diabetes obesity heart disease HIVAIDS neurodevelopmental conditions in children or pregnancy may be subject to more severe symptoms or even develop viral pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome which manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty typically occurs 36 days after initial onset of flu symptoms 1             2   Make sure that you are aware of the dangers of getting the vaccine You should not get the vaccine if you are sick work on a poultry farm et cetera         3   You should definitely get the vaccine if   You live in a remote area that is 350 kilometers 220 mi or more from a medical clinic                  Method  2   Sideeffects          1   Sideeffects include swelling soreness and tenderness at the site of injection vomiting Headache malaise dizziness headache fever and muscle pain Two people had more severe reactions with a much longer spell of nausea muscle pain and malaise that lasted several days There were reports of tingling lips or tongue difficulty breathing hives and skin rashes Thirty six people had serious adverse effects including anaphylaxis and febrile convulsions one woman in her 80s died in Quebec Rare sideeffects are temporary bleeding disorders and GuillainBarr  syndrome GBS a potentially fatal condition involving the system There is the possibility that immune stimulation by vaccines or any other cause might worsen preexisting heart disease A possible case of dystonia has been reported a woman noted flulike symptoms starting ten days after influenza vaccination followed by difficulties with movement and speech This disorder is extremely rare since over the past eighteen years there have been only 5 cases that might have been associated with influenza vaccinations According to the CDC due to the very low numbers of cases the disorder is poorlyunderstood and there is no evidence either for or against it being caused by the vaccinations The Dystonia Medical Research Foundation have stated that it is unlikely that the symptoms in this case are actually dystonia and say that there has never been a validated case of dystonia resulting from a flu shot          Method  3   After you Have Read the Information Above    If you have read the info above and do not have any of the symptoms that you do not need listed above you are ready to move on        1   Find a good medical clinic It is best if the clinic is near you since you can quickly get there         2   Once you have done that go to the clinic The doctor will give you a list of questions Answer them correctly and honestly          3   You will then get the vaccine if you have answered all the required questions as you should have          4   Once you have gotten the vaccine the doctor will keep you in the clinic for 15 minutes to make sure that you are all right

Treatment     View All                 Swine flu is the name for the influenza type A virus that affects pigs swine Although swine flu doesnt typically affect humans there was a global outbreak pandemic in 20092010 the first flu pandemic in more than 40 years It was caused by a thennew flu virus known as H1N1 a type A influenza virus thats a combination of swine avian bird and human genes that mixed together in pigs and spread to humans H1N1 is now considered a normal type of seasonal flu and is included in the flu vaccine       History    H1N1 was first detected in April 2009 in a 10yearold girl in California It was declared a global pandemic in June 2009 by the World Health Organization WHO and was finally over in August 2010      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC estimates that swine flu infected nearly 61 million people in the United States and caused 12469 deaths Worldwide up to 575400 people died from pandemic swine flu        Symptoms    H1N1 causes a respiratory illness and is very contagious Symptoms of H1N1 are similar to those of the seasonal flu and may include      Fever Body aches Loss of appetite A cough A sore throat A headache Fatigue A runny nose Irritated eyes Vomiting nausea and diarrhea       Signs and Symptoms of Swine Flu        Causes    Type A influenza viruses have the ability to mix with other strains creating a new strain which is what happened to cause the pandemic of 2009 to 2010 Pigs are able to contract all three types of influenza human swine and avian creating a place for the virus to mix and change The H1N1 virus is a type A virus with swine human and avian genes that metamorphosed in pigs probably several years before the pandemic and was named swine flu because it was thought to be similar to the viruses known to infect pigs      Influenza circulates among pigs throughout the year but is most common during the late fall and winter similar to the human flu season Sometimes pigs can pass the flu to the humans who work with them through contact with a surface that has been sneezed or coughed on or from inhaling air thats contaminated with the virus This is what happened during the 20092010 pandemic only in this case the new H1N1 strain spread quickly because humans had no immunity to it      The pandemic was declared officially over in 2010 and now H1N1 is considered a normal seasonal flu When people get the H1N1 virus its in the same way you can get any type of flu by contact with another person who is sick from either droplets in the air that contain the live virus or by touching a surface that has been contaminated and then touching your eyes nose or mouth      You cant get influenza from eating pork though you should always make sure that its cooked thoroughly and handled carefully       Causes and Risk Factors of Swine Flu        Diagnosis    If you develop signs of the flu you dont need to see a doctor if youre usually healthy However if youre pregnant your immune system is compromised or you have a chronic illness such as asthma diabetes emphysema or a heart condition you should see your doctor right away      Your doctor will be able to diagnose you with the flu by taking a swab from your nose andor throat within the first four to five days of your sickness There are rapid influenza diagnostic tests that can tell if you have the flu or not as well as which type A or B though they are not as accurate as other tests      There are also rapid molecular assays which are more accurate and can also give a rapid result Since there is more than one strain of influenza A virus strain a positive influenza A test doesnt necessarily mean you have the H1N1 virus To definitively diagnose and classify the strain of influenza you have such as H1N1 your doctor may send your specimen to a specialized hospital or state lab for analysis       How H1N1 Swine Flu Is Diagnosed        Treatment    H1N1 flu is a virus just like any other strain of flu but it does appear to respond to the antiviral medications Tamiflu and Relenza  These medications do not cure the illness but they may shorten the duration make symptoms less severe or help you avoid it altogether if you are exposed They are usually reserved for people who are at a higher risk of complications so the likelihood of the virus developing a resistance to them is lessened      Otherwise treatment for most people mainly consists of comfort measures and treating symptoms as they occur If you have asthma or emphysema for instance your doctor might add a medication to help relieve your respiratory symptoms       How H1N1 Swine Flu Is Treated       A Word From Verywell      As with any type of flu you should have a healthy respect for the H1N1 virus but theres no reason to be afraid Though complications can occur as a result of getting any type of flu getting your annual flu vaccine which also protects against H1N1 washing your hands regularly and thoroughly and staying away from infected people can help lessen your risk of picking up any strain of flu       What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Swine Flu

H1N1 virus flu detected in 2009 It is actually a respiratory disorder symptom of pigs that is caused by type A influenza viruses  Influenza viruses that are commonly circulating among pigsswine are actually the swine influenza viruses or the swine flu viruses  As there are many subtypes and strains in these particular flu viruses there are three types as the major virus causing factors  which was found in the US in the recent years   Swine triple reasserting tr H1N1 Influenza Virus  trH3N2 Virus  trH1N2 Virus   Normally swine flu will not affect humans however few sporadic human infections caused by this deadly virus may occur Science calls such viruses as variant viruses In the US human infections with H1N1v H3N2v and H1N2v viruses have been detected Swine influenza virus SIV is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs As of 2009 the known SIV strains include influenza C and the subtypes of influenza A known as H1N1 H1N2 H3N1 H3N2 and H2N3  The disease has been termed as swine flu because of the virus and the germs being spread from those who are in direct contact with pigs and those who have pig farms As years rolled on few new virus got spread among the people those who never been near pigs As per the news report this is one such infection that spread very fast in 2009 as everyone had scared about it a lot thus the WHO called it a pandemic  Swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human influenza often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood If transmission does cause human influenza it is called zoonotic swine flu People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection The meat of an infected animal poses no risk of infection when properly cooked  As per the medical research the society is getting sick from then onwards Though it was considered as a scaring ailment some few years ago it is now considered as an illness that can be prevented by appropriate vaccination and treatment It is one of the viruses that are included in the vaccine swine flu prevention is very important as it causes serious health issues by seasonal effects   STRUCTURAL VIEW OF H1N1 VIRUS IMAGE SOURCEWIKIPEDIA  Causes  HOW IS IT CAUSEDSPREAD OF DISEASE  Swine Flu basically originated in swine or pigs as SIV generally affects pigs Human got infected by this virus by consuming infected pig meat or coming in direct contact with infected swines Mean it is transferred when virus enters the body through eyes nose or mouth And then human to human transfer occurs This human to human transfer takes place by coming in direct contact with infected person or sharing same clothes and other belongings with that person Its mode of transfer is via air and virus particles travel through air and thus making it more contagious  How is Swine flu transmitted  It gets transmitted as like seasonal  common flu When an H1N1 virus affected person coughs and sneezes the virus get sprayed out as tiny drops into the air The other common human gets contact with those tiny drops say for being near to the affected individual or touching the surface that the affected person has used for eg door knobs chances are indeed heavy to catch H1N1 infection immediately The virus from the affected individuals can get spread out in a day and the symptoms for an adult will reveal out only after 7 days wherein the symptoms can be found only after 10 days for kids  Studies say to avoid in taking of bacon ham and any other pork related food stuff could be one of the best swine flu prevention apart from vaccination But few other researchers find that by having pork  pork related eatables will not lead to such infection However the completely boiled and cooked pork food is completely safe on either of the sides  How humans get infected  Humans are being affected by influenza illness on a major cause As per science the influenza viruses of type A B  C have actually encased RNA viruses with a segmented genome of 8 eight different RNA segments An influenza virus that affects humans might cause  affect the respiratory system of swine actually as swine influenza virus That is with reproduced RNA strands from the humans affecting virus which got enclosed by mistaken inside the encased swine influenza virus For better understanding it is that of one cell can hold 8 eight numbers of swine flu and human flu RNA segments There are actually 16 types of RNA variations hence four for each swine and the humans  which could find incorporated into one single particle  Various RNA segment combinations can result in new subtypes antigenic shift wherein the higher possibilities to affect humans And on the other part pigs play a big role as transitional host to catch hold of new varieties of bird flu causes pigs respiratory cells are down with immune power hence the get infected by the bird flu easily and almost easily get infected by other mammalian flu viruses even Its respiratory bag will look like a pot with mixed viruses hence it transmits the disease to the humans easily when anyone gets in direct handling of swine  INCUBATION PERIOD  The incubation period for swine flu time between infection and appearance of symptoms can be up to seven days but is most likely to be between two and five days It is however at this stage there is no certainty about the incubation period  Swine flu Symptoms  The symptoms of H1N1 flu might actually develop within 1 to 3 days of being infected Most of the people will show in a day as we discussed early However when you notice any a persistent cough with prolonging tiredness for more than a week then you have to be serious in taking care of you The symptoms of HIN1 flu virus human swine flu are very similar to those of seasonal human influenza    Appending below are few of the core symptoms of swine flu infection   A sudden fever with increasing temperature generally more than 39 C andor 103 F  Dry and chest a persisting cough  Lingering headache  Prolonging tiredness  weakness  Feeling very chill in the palms and the toes  Pain in muscles and bones  Joints pain and limbs pain  Diarrhea with abdominal pain  Vomiting and nausea  Sore throat  Running nose or blocked nose  Unremitting sneezes  Disturbed sleep  Loss of appetite   The severity of symptoms can vary from mild to severe and sometimes require hospitalization In some cases severe complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure can cause death Like the seasonal flu swine flu may worsen existing chronic medical conditions The symptoms that occur commonly among flu infection and cold are the following  There are quite a few of these that occur in the human bodies and finding out whether it is just cold or is it flu is a challenging factor Appending below are the main differences  Flu Symptoms   Come on immediately  Unusual increasing of fever temperature and pain muscles  joints  Feeling damn tired that will not let the infected individual to carry on hisher daily routine simple jobs   Common Cold Symptoms   Come on gradually but not often and a persistent one  Particularly affect the nose and throat areas  The cold infected individual can get around once after taking necessary mild treatments   Swine flu complication  Most probably tricky situations of swine flu can be seen on the people with higher medical risks say for instance pregnant women elderly citizens those who have weakened the immune system and those who are all under longterm medications It is highly recommended and important that the above groups must go for annual vaccination without any excuses  Appending below are the complications that lead from swine flu infection   Chest complication The most commonly seen swine flu chest complications are bronchitis and pneumonia on the serious condition A course of heavy dosage will treat bronchitis however the other one is indeed risk curing off wherein it is lifethreatening on few factors especially for the ages of weak and elderly ones Thus the likely cause of pneumonia can be prevented by proper vaccination on right age    Pregnancy complication Swine flu infection during pregnancy is highly risk factor wherein it can affect the pregnancy which will lead to miscarriage stillbirth or premature labor and might result in low birth weight during delivery Hence the medical foundation is insisting the pregnant women go for annual vaccination without missing    Deteriorating of current health conditions People who are under longterm medical supervision are at high risk when they are affected by swine flu in which it will worsen their current health condition very badlyWhen people with lung diseases say for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might find their health condition very bad when they got affected by swine flu infectionPeople with diabetes when get affected by swine flu might see increasing blood sugar levels which will then lead to hyperglycemia risks of higher blood sugar and for those who are all in type 1 diabetes might affect from diabetic ketoacidosis a fatal condition caused by swine flu infection where insulin level in their body might go very down    Other complications Appending below are a list of medical worries that happen rarely but of very serious and dangerous    Encephalitis Inflammation of the brain  Febrile Seizures convulsions Fits that can affect children when having high temperature  Meningitis An infection that affect the spinal cord and the brain  Otitis media An infection that affect the ear especially that worsening the middle part of the ear  Tonsillitis Inflammation of tonsils which is uncommon from the normal tonsil infection  Sinusitis Inflammation in the sinus tiny  air filled cavities found behind the cheekbones and the forehead part on the human body linings   Thus swine flu prevention is highly recommended to avoid suffering from the worsened situations Sometimes it leads to fatal conditions which happen from the cause of secondary bacterial infection of the lungs disorders As per the reported study the mortality rate on type A virus infection was off 01 H1N1 virus infection was of about 160 fatal circumstances with 2500 confirmed conditions  the mortality rate was of 06 And as per the Presidents Advisory Committee the average conventional flu mortality circumstances is about 36144 per year  Fortunately the mortality rates and the fatal syndromes are lowered down by proper awareness of vaccination increased hygiene level the rapid development of a new vaccine and wellunderstood selfisolation by affected individuals  Swine flu prevention  Prevention is better that cure is a rightly said maxim It gets transmitted as we have discussed earlier in this topic The major measures to stay away from even the common cold are off   Washing hands by using any of the antibiotic liquidsoapgel andor bar in warm water  Do clean the surfaces that the affected individual uses say for door knobs balcony chairs keyboard  the mouse and all the surfaces that the swine fluinfected person touches  uses  Cover mouth  nose areas when sneezing or coughing  Throwing away the used tips into trash bins properly   Swine flu vaccine Taking up of annual swine flu vaccine will help to fight against such H1N1 type of virus and will reduce the risk of being affected by this disease   A swine flu vaccine is open for the belowappended persons  Any individual who is more than 60 years of old  Any individual who is of overweight  Pregnant ladies  Adults and children who are all with underlying health condition  Adults and children with weakened immune system   Adults above 18 and children aged between 6 months to 2 years are generally given an annual vaccine injection wherein children below 2 years are given annual nasal spray The right time to go for swine flu vaccination is that autumn September to November Taking up of the vaccination is very important in each year as the virus of winter may vary  change from last winters Hence by annual vaccination you can stay safe  Sideeffects Almost all the vaccinations are accompanied with minimal side effects Common side effects of H1N1 vaccines both single or with a combination of other flu viral strands show below appending side effects  Flu vaccination In another term as known as flu shots show redness soreness mild swelling on the injected area muscle pain the lowgrade temperature for less than 24 hours  Nasal spray Nasal spray for children below 2 years will show the side effect signs of a runny nose lowlevel temperature cough sore throat vomiting for not more than 1 day  Intradermal vaccination Redness soreness muscle pain headache accompanied by fatigue can be seen as side effects  Antiviral treatment To prevent from being affected by the flu in the following conditions antiviral medicines of Oseltamivir for Tamiflu or Zanamivir for Relenza are to be taken necessarily   When there is flu infection in the society  When you are pregnant or age of 65  When you are under any such medical circumstances that left you at the risk of flu complications which include but not just limited to diabetes lung diseases heart diseases neurological diseases et al  When you have contact with the individuals having flu  flu kind illness must start the antiviral treatment within 3648 hours  When you are not taken any set of effective vaccination so far   Signs to be noticed when you are effectually safe by swine flu vaccination are as appending below   If you are not vaccinated in the last winter  Though you took the vaccination but of not effective  Circumstance that you cannot be vaccinated  If you took any set of flu vaccination which is different from the type that is being spread in the society currently   Swine flu detecting tests Whether any individual show symptoms of H1N1 disease that we discussed early in the above paragraphs must go for swine flu test  The lab doctor will run a swab  inside of your bathroom and the other one inside of the nasal part around the back of the throat to collect samples for the test The tests are highly advised to those who are in the hospital and those who have higher risks of lifethreatening illness Appending below are the situations to go test immediately   Kids those are of less than 5 years old  Elderly group of 65  65  Teens under 18 and especially those who are taking longterm treatment of aspirin therapy and who are at risks of Reyes syndrome Reyes syndrome is the cause of a lifethreatening illness that comes once after a heavy swine flu infection  Adults and children with chronic lung disease lingering heart problems liver issues blood system difficulties nervous disorders neuromuscular and metabolic problems  Those who are with weakened immune system  Individuals who are under HIV treatment  People who work in hospitals  nursing homes and especially those who work longer years in care facilities   Maintaining a sound hygiene  Apart from vaccination and antiviral medication treatment swine flu can be well prevented by maintaining a good hygiene To avoid the chances of getting catch by this ailment is stop spreading the virus at first  Maintaining good hygiene is that not doing one whole complete day but only once It is a regular one where you have to clean your surface always clean hence adequate cleaning is required The Health  Hygiene expert Professor Sally Bloomfield London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine states that Good hygiene is not a onceweekly deepdown clean Hygienic cleaning needs to be an ongoing part of our daily lives where hygiene measures are targeted where and when necessary  She adds that germs and virus can multiply fast Within 8 hours of the time period one bacterium on a soggy cloth can multiply into 6 million in numbers Germs when to grow and stick with the cloth is hard to shoo away hence hard washing by using disinfectants must be required which are then required to dry off in hot sunlight In addition clean your surface with antidisinfectant liquids and once after cleaning make sure to clean off the cleaning aids such as mops cloths to be germfree to avoid germs  virus multiplication  Appending below are few of the hygiene tips that to be must follow all round the clock but especially in the autumn where the power of swine flu spread happens more   Use disposable tissues and cloths to clean and trash them properly  Wash the brush cleaners by using a hard detergent with hot water after every use  Use lavatory cleaner and brush wash it every alternate day  Dont store water clean and keep the water filling utensils  buckets empty once after every use  Clean the shower trays often  Ensure the kitchen area to be very tidy  Dispose of the wastages properly  Keep pets away from households   When as swine flu infection is among one of your family   Separate the clothes while washing theirs  Just do maintain the abovegiven points on each use   Hence   Be sure not touching any surfaces that are being used by other people in the public  Make sure of yourself to wash your hands often with antibiotic handwash or bar with hot water  Clean all the surfaces that you have used and touched  Use tissues and napkins to cover your mouth  nose well while coughing and sneezing  Dispose of the used tissues in the trash bin covered properly   HOW SWINE FLU IS DIAGNOSED  We have a specialized test for Swine flu This test is recommended by NICD National Institute Of Communicable Diseases  SAMPLE  Respiratory specimens including throat swab and nasopharyngeal nasal swabs are taken from ambulatory patients  From incubated patients admitted in the ICU the sample is bronchoalveolar lavage or tracheal aspirates Samples are transported in special viral transport medium which is packed in such a way that there is no chance of contaminating the environment or it being a risk to those handling the box  METHOD  The methodology being used is real time detection and identification of the swine flu virus using the protocol from CDC Atlanta USA  The first step is RNA extraction of the virus The target sequences are amplified and the detection occurs simultaneously  The CDC realtime RTPCR rRTPCR protocol for the detection and characterization of Swine Influenza includes a panel of oligonucleotide primers and dual labeled probes to be used in real time RTPCR assays for the invitro qualtitative detection and characterization of swine influenza viruses in respiratory specimens and viral cultures The first primerprobe set Influenza A is designed for universal detection of type A influenza viruses The swInfA primer and probe set is designed specifically to detect all swine influenza A viruses The swH1 set is designed specifically to detect swine H1 influenza The fourth set detects the human Rnase P gene and reflects that the assay has been carried out properly without any inhibition of PCR  INTERPRETATION  A sample is said to be positive for Swine flu H1N1 if all three targets ie Influenza A H1N1 Influenza A and H1N1 Influenza A subtype H1 are detected If a sample is positive for only two of the above targets a repeat sample is recommended If all four targets are negative a repeat sample should be done   A negative result does not preclude the presence of Influenza A H1N1 infection because results depend on adequate specimen collection absence of inhibitors and sufficient RNA to be detected  Treatment  HOW SWINE FLU IS TREATED  After testing positive for swine flu  patient should immediately quarantined in an isolated room or in hospital  National institute of communicable diseaseNICD information says that the swine flu can be treated if caught very early with two of the antiviral medications oseltamivir TamifluFluvir and zanamivir Relenza Tamiflu is for treatment in adults and children aged 1 year and older and must be taken within 48 hours of the first symptom  Till now this strain of influenza virus is in a dynamic state means there is no consistency in scientific terms it keeps on mutating in its level of occurrence because evidently in some patients its being treated successfully with Tamilflu and in some tamilflu is ineffective And moreover at present there is no effective vaccine present  So basically precaution is the best treatment  PRECAUTION  As the flu is now spreading via person toperson contact the infection primarily spreads when a person comes in close contact with an infected person The simple way to minimize the risk is by covering the mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing and wearing a mask while going close to the infected person  Maintaining high level of hygiene is also important and one should always wash hands frequently with soap and water  Since influenza spreads through both air and contact with contaminated surfaces surface sanitizing may help prevent some infections For that alcohol is an effective sanitizer bleach can also be used to sanitize rooms or equipment that have been occupied by patients with influenza symptoms  Few FAQs to clarify you   Can I get affected with swine flu by eating pork   No not exactly the H1N1 virus spreads by eating pork and porkrelated food stuff However it is advised to have completely cooked and boiled pork foodstuff   Is the vaccine safe   Absolutely yes However some people may react with allergic conditions once after getting the vaccine You can inform your doctor if you ever had an allergic symptom during your earlier vaccination No need to panic wherein the allergic conditions are having a slight fever or could be an allergic reaction against intake of egg or chicken for some few days   What is the situation to consider going to a doctor   Though you are falling under the group of risk fellows but still you feel a fear of H1N1 infection you should notice the following signs  symptoms of swine flu to give immediate medical attention For adults difficulty while breathing convulsions and breath shortness For children difficulty in waking up could not drink enough fluids subsequent temperature of fever persistent cough  cold fever accompanied by rashes and punishing irritability that even makes the elder push away them   What are all the factors for swine flu prevention   Apart from vaccination you can run yourself in following the belowappending checklist to safeguard yourself in getting catch hold from this deadly disease   Dont touch the surfaces randomly when the atmosphere is occupied by any affected individuals  Avoid them for few days  Try not to share any set of things   If you are an affected individual please stop spreading the virus   Dont come out of your home until you recover  Use tissues or napkins while sneezing coughing and trash the used tissues properly  Wash your hands in warm water by using antibiotic hand wash  Try using sanitizers  Dont touch your mouth nose and eyes the dwelling parts of the virus  Dont share your personal items or the stuff and things that you used with anyone until you recover     Swine Flu  Causes Symptoms Treatments Complications  Precautions was last modified March 17th 2018 by Team Dr Lal PathLabs     Share on Facebook Share on Twitter

viruses These viruses also infect the respiratory system of pigs causing barking cough decrease in appetite nasal secretions and listless behavior Influenza viruses can also be transmitted to humans Swine flu viruses can induce genetic changes or mutations so that these are easily transmissible among humans In April 2009 swine flu outbreak was first detected in Mexico and was caused due to the H1N1 virus  Symptoms of swine flu infection in humans are similar to influenza infection these include cough nasal secretions headache fatigue and fever temp 100 F or higher The gestation period of the disease is around one to four days Swine flu can be transmitted from the day before the signs develop and can also transmit within five to seven days after signs develop Some patients might be able to transmit for an extended time span The disease lasts for about three to seven days while severe infections could last for nearly nine to ten days Vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease  Influenza vaccine makes a significant division of global vaccine market Rising awareness about influenza A swine flu H1N1 epidemic in 2009 and rise in health responsiveness in developing nations have played an important role in identifying the dynamics of the global influenza market Trivalent flu vaccine protect against influenza B H3N2 and influenza A viruses H1N1 After Trivalent flu vaccine quadrivalent vaccines offered which comprise two influenza B strains along with the standard two influenza A strains H3N2 and H1N1 The two influenza B strains offer safety against both types of B families which spread in varying proportions The quadrivalent flu vaccine is developed to defend against four unlike flu viruses for two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses comprised one influenza B virus an influenza A H3N2 virus and an influenza A H1N1 virus The research scientists in the novel study were capable to formulate a vaccine which formed antibodies from the stem cells These vaccines were successful among diverse laboratory animals including monkeys ferrets and mice and secured against flu strains like H1N1 swine flu and H5N1 avian flu Scientists are a step closer to develop a common flu vaccine to defend against all strains of the virus  Governmental initiatives and increase in awareness about swine flu are the major drivers of the swine flu vaccine market This is expected to encourage market players to gain a better understanding of the regulatory framework product pricing marketing technological innovations and market dynamics  The global swine flu vaccine market can be segmented based on type of delivery device route of administration enduser and region In terms of type of delivery device the global swine flu vaccine market can be classified into syringes jet injectors and other devices Based on route of administration the global swine flu market can be categorized into intradermal vaccination intramuscular vaccination subcutaneous vaccination and other vaccinations In terms of enduser the market can be divided into hospital pharmacies retail pharmacies online pharmacies and clinic  vaccination centers Based on region the global

attached to the sprayer is equipped with a nozzle that produces a fine mist that is primarily deposited in the nose and nasopharynx  NASOVAC is supplied as a vial containing freezedried cake in USP type 1 glass vials A ampoulevial containing sterile water for inhalation as diluent syringe for reconstitution of multi dose vaccine vial syringe for administration  needle free device and intranasal spray device are also supplied along with the vaccine  The vaccine complies with the WHO recommendation and EU decision for the pandemic  INDICATIONS  NASOVAC Intranasal is indicated for the active immunization of individuals above 3 years of age against influenza disease caused by pandemic H1N1 2009 virus  Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation see sections Posology and method of administration and Pharmacodynamic properties  Pandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with official guidance  POSOLOGY AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION  Each freezedried vaccine vial is reconstituted using the entire contents of sterile water for inhalation that is supplied along with the vaccine using the supplied syringe and vial adapter  A dose of 05 ml is administered as 025 ml per nostril using a 0510 ml syringe and a spray device The sprayer device creates a fine spray that primarily deposits the vaccine in the nose and nasopharynx A single intranasal dose is recommended for people above 3 years of age  Adults 1849 years elderly  50 years and children and adolescents 317 years of age A single dose of 0 5 ml by intranasal route A second dose of vaccine could be given after an interval of at least 21 days  There is no clinical experience in children below 3 years of age  For further information see  Pharmacodynamic properties   If the vaccine is not used immediately then it should be stored at 28 C for no longer than 6 hours While storing the reconstituted vaccine ensure that the administration syringe is locked on to the needle free transfer device and the combined unit is stored at 2 to 8 C to ensure that the opening created by the device is blocked and the syringe is also stored in a manner which prevents the proliferation of bioburden Any opened container remaining at the end of a session within six hours of reconstitution should be discarded  The diluent supplied is specially designed for use with the vaccine Only this diluent must be used to reconstitute the vaccine Do not use diluents from other types of vaccine or from other manufacturers Using an incorrect diluent may result in damage to the vaccine andor serious reactions to those receiving the vaccine Diluent must not be frozen but should be kept cool  The diluent and reconstituted vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and  or variation of physical aspects prior to administration In the event of either being observed discard the diluent or reconstituted vaccine  CONTRAINDICATIONS  Hypersensitivity  NASOVAC is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity especially anaphylactic reactions to eggs egg proteins gentamicin gelatin or arginine or with lifethreatening reactions to previous influenza vaccinations  Concomitant Pediatric and Adolescent Aspirin Therapy and Reyes syndrome  NASOVAC is contraindicated in children and adolescents 317 years of age receiving aspirin therapy or aspirin containingtherapy because of the association of Reyes syndrome with aspirin and wildtype influenza infection  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Caution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity other than anaphylactic reaction to the active substances to any of the excipients and to residues eg eggs chicken proteins etc  As with all vaccines appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine  Do not administer NASOVAC to children 36 months of age since there is no clinical data available  NASOVAC should not be administered to any individuals with asthma or children  5 years of age with recurrent wheezing because of the potential for increased risk of wheezing post vaccination unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk  Do not administer NASOVAC to individuals with severe asthma or active wheezing because these individuals have not been studied in clinical trials  If GuillainBarr  syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of any prior influenza vaccination the decision to give NASOVAC should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and potential risks  If the pandemic situation allows immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection  The vaccine can be given to people with minor illnesses eg diarrhea or mild upper respiratory tract infection with or without fever However if nasal congestion is present that might limit delivery of the vaccine to the nasal lining then delaying of vaccination until the nasal congestion is reduced should be considered  People who are in contact with others with severely compromised immune systems should not get NASOVAC  NASOVAC should under no circumstances be injected  Administration of NASOVAC to immunocompromised persons should be based on careful consideration of potential benefits and risks There is no clinical data available on the use of this vaccine in immunocompromised persons  Antibody response in such patients may be insufficient  The safety of NASOVAC in individuals with underlying medical conditions that may predispose them to complications following wildtype influenza infection has not been established NASOVAC should not be administered unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk  DRUG INTERACTIONS  Do not administer NASOVAC to children or adolescents who are receiving aspirin therapy or aspirincontaining therapy see Contraindications  The concurrent use of NASOVAC with antiviral agents that are active against influenza A andor B viruses has not been evaluated However based upon the potential for antiviral agents to reduce the effectiveness of NASOVAC do not administer this vaccine until 48 hours after the cessation of antiviral therapy and antiviral agents should not be administered until two weeks after administration of this vaccine unless medically indicated If antiviral agents and NASOVAC are administered concomitantly revaccination should be considered when appropriate  There are no data on coadministration of NASOVAC with other vaccines However if coadministration with another vaccine is indicated immunisation may be carried It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified  There are no data regarding coadministration of NASOVAC with other intranasal preparations The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment  Following influenza vaccination false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA method to detect antibodies against HIV1 Hepatitis C and especially HTLV1 have been observed The Western Blot technique may disprove the false positive results and confirm the true results The transient false positive reactions could be due to the IgM response by the vaccine  Pregnancy and lactation  Data from vaccinations with unadjuvanted interpandemic trivalent vaccines in pregnant women do not indicate that adverse foetal and maternal outcomes were attributable to the vaccine  Animal teratogenicity studies are ongoing with NASOVAC It is not known whether NASOVAC can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity Healthcare providers need to assess the benefit and potential risks of administering the vaccine to pregnant women  It is not known whether NASOVAC is excreted in human milk Therefore as some viruses are excreted in human milk and additionally because of the possibility of shedding of vaccine virus and the close proximity of a nursing infant and mother caution should be exercised if NASOVAC is administered to nursing mothers  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  The vaccine is unlikely to produce an effect on the ability to drive and use machines  ADVERSE REACTIONS  In clinical trials a few local and systemic reaction were observed They were mild to moderate in severity and resolved without any sequelae  Local  Nasal discomfort stuffy nose sneezing runny nose loss of smell red eyes lacrimation facial swelling  Systemic  Headache fatigue myalgia arthralgia irritability loss of appetite sore throat cough diarrhoea  The incidence was similar in both the study groups  There were a few unsolicited event reported in both the groups and none of them were causally related to study vaccines  OVERDOSE  No case of overdose has been reported  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  Pharmacodynamic properties  NASOVAC is a live monovalent vaccine for administration by intranasal spray The influenza virus strain in NASOVAC is a coldadapted ca ie it replicates efficiently at 25 C a temperature that is restrictive for replication of many wildtype influenza viruses b temperaturesensitive ts ie it is restricted in replication at 39 C a temperature at which many wildtype influenza viruses grow efficiently and c attenuated att it does not produce classic influenzalike illness in the ferret model of human influenza infection The cumulative effect of the antigenic properties and the ca ts and att phenotypes is that the attenuated vaccine virus replicates in the nasopharynx to induce protective immunity  Immune mechanisms conferring protection against influenza following receipt of Intranasal Live attenuated influenza vaccines are not fully understood though it is wellestablished that these vaccines provide clinical protection to the majority of the vaccinees Likewise naturally acquired immunity to wildtype influenza has not been completely elucidated Serum antibodies and mucosal antibodies may play a role in prevention and recovery from infection  However it is well known that there are no correlates of protection for live attenuated influenza vaccines  Pharmacokinetic properties  Not applicable  Preclinical safety data  NASOVAC has undergone Singledose and Repeateddose toxicity studies in mice and rats when administered intranasally In singledose studies higher than normal doses of the vaccine were given to animals and they were observed for 14 days for toxic effects No vaccinerelated untoward effects were found in animals receiving NASOVAC  In repeateddose toxicity studies three doses of higher than normal doses of the vaccine were given intranasally to animals on day 0 7 and 14 and were subsequently sacrificed Necropsy was done to assess adverse effects on any organs No vaccinerelated adverse effects were found in the study animals receiving NASOVAC  INCOMPATIBILITIES  In the absence of compatibility studies this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND HANDLING AND DISPOSAL  The vaccine should be allowed to reach room temperature before use Shake before use Once NASOVAC Intranasal has been administered the sprayer should be disposed of according to the standard procedures for medical waste eg sharps container or biohazard container  SHELFLIFE  Do not exceed the expiry date printed on the outer box  STORAGE  NASOVAC Influenza VaccineHumanLive Attenuated Intranasal SHOULD BE STORED IN A REFRIGERATOR AT 28 C 3546 F UPON RECEIPT AND UNTIL USE THE PRODUCT MUST BE USED BEFORE THE EXPIRATION DATE ON THE LABEL The cold chain 2 to 8 C must be maintained when transporting Influenza VaccineHumanLive Attenuated Intranasal  PRESENTATION  NASOVAC Influenza VaccineHumanLive Attenuated Intranasal is available as   1 dose vial plus diluent  05 ml  5 dose vial plus diluent 25 ml   MOST IMPORTANT WARNING   Please ensure that the vaccine is administered by intranasal spray In rare cases anaphylactic shock may occur in susceptible individual and for such emergency please keep handy 11000 adrenaline injection ready to be injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously For treatment of severe anaphylaxis the initial dose of adrenaline is 0105 mg 0105ml of 11000 injection given sc or im Single dose should not exceed 1 mg 1ml For infants and children the recommended dose of adrenaline is 001mgkg 001mlkg of 11000 injection Single pediatric dose should not exceed 05mg 05ml This will help in tackling the anaphylactic shockreaction effectively  The mainstay in the treatment of severe anaphylaxis is the prompt use of adrenaline which can be lifesaving It should be used at the first suspicion of anaphylaxis As with the use of all vaccines the vaccinees should remain under observation for not less than 30 minutes for possibility of occurrence of rapid allergic reactions Hydrocortisone and antihistaminics should also be available in addition to supportive measures such as oxygen inhalation     Write Review  Your Name     Your Review   Note HTML is not translated   Rating  Bad       Good   Enter the code in

Natural News Sunday October 9 2011 NaturalNews The nation of Finland has now openly admitted that the swine flu vaccine conclusively causes narcolepsy  a chronic nervous system disorder that makes people uncontrollably fall asleep  The Finnish government in acknowledging this link says it will pay for lifetime medical care for 79 children who have been irreparably damaged by the swine flu vaccine  httpnewsyahoocomfinlandvows  Narcolepsy isnt the only side effect now admitted to be caused by swine flu vaccines 76 of the 79 children also suffered hallucinations and paralyzing physical collapses say Finnish researchers Remarkably even though the link between swine flu vaccines and permanent neurological damage in children is now openly admitted by the Finnish government there is absolutely no talk about halting the utterly unscientific ritual of injecting children with flu vaccines in the first place Not only are flu vaccines harmful to children as is now admitted but flu vaccines dont even work A simple daily dose of vitamin D would do far more to halt influenza than any vaccine  httpwwwnaturalnewscom029760v    US refuses to admit vaccines harm anyone  The US government of course still refuses to admit vaccines cause any harm whatsoever Both the government and the vaccine industry continue to push the fabricated fairy tale that vaccines are safe and effective meaning they harm no one but help everyone Yet the truth is practically the polar opposite Vaccines harm countless millions of children each year in ways that are usually never linked to vaccines mild mental retardation suppressed immune function learning disabilities etc At the same time vaccines are all but worthless at preventing infections  Even the vaccine industrys own research shows that flu shots only work on 1 out of 100 people meaning theyre completely useless for 99 percent of those who take them  httpwwwnaturalnewscom029641v  Instead of admitting the truth that vaccines cause autism the US government has conspired with vaccine manufacturers to create a Vaccine Injury Compensation Program which essentially pays hush money to parents of permanently harmed children to make sure they cannot bring their claims of harm to federal courts  httpwwwnaturalnewscom033635v  Even worse the medical establishment  which is heavily influenced if not downright dominated by pharmaceutical interests  absolutely refuses to advocate vitamin D as a flu prevention nutrient Vitamin D is safe effective and affordable Its available without a prescription and could save literally billions of dollars in national health care costs for just pennies per day per person So why wont the medical establishment promote vitamin D Precisely because it would cost the industry billions of dollars in lost profits from all the sickness and degenerative disease that is prevented by vitamin D Of course vaccines cause autism  There is absolutely no question in the mind of any reasonably informed person that vaccines cause neurological damage  including but not limited to autism Only the corporatewhore scientists around the world continue their charade that vaccines are not linked to autism or that vaccines even work in the first place Most Americans havent yet heard the secret interview with Merck vaccine scientist Dr Maurice Hilleman where he openly admits vaccines carry dozens of strains of cancercausing stealth viruses Read the transcript here  httpwwwnaturalnewscom033584D  Listen to the interview at  httpnaturalnewstvvaspv13EAA  Similarly most people still dont know that Dr Jonas Salk  the celebrated grandfather of vaccines who is credited with creating the polio vaccine was an unindicted medical criminal who committed heinous crimes against humanity in the name of medical science  httpwwwnaturalnewscom031564J  In fact the whole history of vaccines and medicine has been utterly distorted by the medical establishment to paint vaccines in a glorified light of public health But the real story is that vaccines are now  and have always been  tools for causing disease and promoting sickness so that the pharmaceutical industry can benefit as a result The horrifying truth about the vaccine industry and medical establishment  Remember this is the same industry that got caught conducting outrageous medical experiments on Guatemalan prisoners  httpwwwnaturalnewscom033483G  These are the same people who ran Tuskegee experiments on African Americans too  httpwwwnaturalnewscom029924m   A d v e r t i s e m e n t  openx74  Do you honestly think these same vaccine criminals would not also use innocent children for their own mass inoculation medical experiments Remember These are hardcore Nazistyle criminals were talking about here This is who runs the pharmaceutical industry The former chairperson of Bayer for example was a convicted Nazi war criminal who was indicted and sentenced at the Nuremburg trials Dont believe me Read your history Dr Fritz ter Meer a director of IG Farben who was directly involved in developing the nerve gas ZyklonB which killed millions of Jews was sentenced to seven years in prison but was released after four years through the intervention of Rockefeller and JJ McCloy then US High Commissioner for Germany An unrepentant Fritz ter Meer guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity returned to work in Bayer where he served as Chairman for more than 10 years until 1961 This same ter Meer a convicted Nazi war criminal went on to become one of the initiators of the Codex Alimentarius Commission in 1962 an organization that was nurtured by the World Health Organization WHO the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO and latterly the World Trade Organization WTO   httpwwwnaturalnewscom024534E  Governments know vaccines maim and kill children  thats exactly why they push them so aggressively  You see every world government already knows that vaccines are murder  They know vaccines kill and maim children They know vaccines cause autism and neurological disorders They know this and then they keep promoting vaccines anyway  Why Because they are mass murderers who have philosophical roots in Nazi Germany and the eugenics movement Even todays FDA can be traced backed to eugenics and population control Bill Gates who promotes world vaccination openly admits that vaccines and health care can reduce world population by 10 to 15 percent if they do a good job  httpwwwnaturalnewscom029911v  Dont believe me Watch Bill Gates say it himself in this video  httpwwwnaturalnewstvvaspvA  Vaccines are not given to children with the accident that they kill some children and cause neurological disorders in others no they are given to children BECAUSE they cause neurological disorders organ failure infertility reduced intelligence and numerous other side effects Todays vaccines create tomorrows health care customers  you see Vaccines keep Big Pharma in business based on repeat profits  How else is Big Pharma supposed to ensure its future profits if the population were actually allowed to stay healthy The whole point of vaccines is to DAMAGE HUMAN HEALTH and rake in trillions of dollars in longterm profits from all the suffering and disease caused by those vaccines Cmon folks Do you really think all these forprofit companies are trying to HELP humanity Do you really think drug company CEOs are goodygoody humanitarians who would give up their shareholder profits and drive their own companies out of business by promoting lasting health Wake up people Wake up and smell the coffee Drug companies think absolutely nothing of murdering Nigerian children  httpwwwnaturalnewscom023654html  or even using your own children as medical experiments as long as they make more money in the process  And as the editor of NaturalNews having seen countless documents tips testimonials and other sources of information that have been given to me over the years I can tell you with absolute certainty that the pharmaceutical industry is actively using vaccines to CAUSE degenerative disease as a way to lock in future profits from that disease Vaccines are a business continuity strategy used by the forprofit pharmaceutical industry  Its just like a greasy car mechanic throwing some solvents into your gas tank so that you have to come back for engine repairs after a few hundred miles The drug companies are willing to do anything to guarantee their profits and that includes committing acts of genocide against the human race as long as it fattens their bottom line profits We are not dealing with ethical principled human beings in the pharmaceutical industry folks We are dealing with criminalminded monsters who have found a way to selfishly enrich themselves at the expense and suffering of others And they relish in it They get off on watching children suffer and die from their vaccines They get a rise out of the fact that they are pulling off this scam with such success that the sheeple of the world will actually line up at their local pharmacies and beg to be injected with the very chemical adjuvants and live viral materials that will destroy their health and turn them into lifetime medical victims  The sick demented medical elite who engineer all this which includes top people at the FDA by the way are like modernday vampires who suck the life out of innocent little children in order to feed their own devilish appetites for wealth and power And watching it all happen every day in America Finland and everywhere else around the world is absolutely infuriating Thats why I work so hard to expose these medical quacks for the true criminals they really are These people who lead Big Pharma and the vaccine industry would infect your baby with cancer if it guaranteed them chemotherapy profits two decades down the road These people should be arrested thrown in prison and charged with their role in these crimes against humanity Occupy Wall Street is just one movement thats rising up in opposition to the total scam of the fraudulent banking industry and the Federal Reserve but we need another movement Occupy Big Pharma where the sick degenerate masses who have been harmed by all these vaccines and deadly pharmaceuticals march on the drug companies and arrest their CEOs for crimes against humanity I know that day is coming There will be a day when the angry diseased masses figure out the depth of the medical crimes that have been committed against them in the name of public health and they will rage against the machine  To all the vaccine company CEOs out there Enjoy your millions right now because there will come a day when you have to answer for how you got that money and who really had to pay the price for your financial windfall Hundreds of millions of children are harmed today around the world because of vaccines and that number will continue to rise with each passing year that we allow humanity to be chemically assaulted by these biological weapons known as vaccines                                 Related Articles          Democrat Blames Trump For Democrats Blacking Up In The Past    US News    Comments

    SWINE FLU DrTVRao MD   2 What is Swine Flu ulliSwine influenza virus  referred to as  SIV  refers to influenza cases that are caused by Orthomyxovirus endemic to pig populations SIV strains isolated to date have been classified either as Influenzavirus C or one of the various subtypes of the genus Influenza virus A liul   3 Different Strains circulate Periodically ulliIn the United States the H1N1 subtype was exclusively prevalent among swine populations before 1998 however since late August 1998 H3N2 subtypes have been isolated from pigs As of 2004 H3N2 virus isolates in US swine and turkey stocks were triple reassortants containing genes from human HA NA and PB1 swine NS NP and M and avian PB2 and PA lineages liul   4 MAP of H1 N1 Swine Flu   5 Swine Influenza Flu ulliSwine Influenza swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza that regularly cause outbreaks of influenza among pigs Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans however human infections with swine flu do occur and cases of humantohuman spread of swine flu viruses has been documented  liul   6 Pigs can harbour influenza viruses can be adapted to Humans   7 Swine FluPresent Status ulliFrom December 2005 through February 2009 a total of 12 human infections with swine influenza were reported from 10 states in the United States Since March 2009 a number of confirmed human cases of a new strain of swine influenza A H1N1 virus infection in the US and internationally have been identified An investigation into these cases is ongoing  liul   8 Swine Flu 2009 ulliIn late March and early April 2009 cases of human infection with swine influenza A H1N1 viruses were first reported in Southern California and near San Antonio Texas Other US states have reported cases of swine flu infection in humans and cases have been reported internationally as well  liul   9 Update  Status Swine Flu ulliThe United States Government has reported seven confirmed human cases of Swine Influenza AH1N1 in the USA five in California and two in Texas and nine suspect cases All seven confirmed cases had mild InfluenzaLike Illness ILI with only one requiring brief hospitalization No deaths have been reported  liul   10 Swine Flu in Mexico ulliIn the Federal District of Mexico surveillance began picking up cases of ILI starting 18 March The number of cases has risen steadily through April and as of 23 April there are now more than 854 cases of pneumonia from the capital Of those 59 have died In San Luis Potosi in central Mexico 24 cases of ILI with three deaths have been reported  liul   11 Swine Flu and Virus ulliSwine Influenza swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza virus that regularly causes outbreaks of influenza in pigs Swine flu viruses cause high levels of illness and low death rates in pigs Swine influenza viruses may circulate among swine throughout the year but most outbreaks occur during the late fall and winter months similar to outbreaks in humans The classical swine flu virus an influenza type A H1N1 virus was first isolated from a pig in 1930  liul   12 Cause by Reassortment of different strains ulliLike all influenza viruses swine flu viruses change constantly Pigs can be infected by avian influenza and human influenza viruses as well as swine influenza viruses When influenza viruses from different species infect pigs the viruses can reassort ie swap genes and new viruses that are a mix of swine human andor avian influenza viruses can emerge  liul   13 Swine Flu differs from Human Flu ulliThe H1N1 swine flu viruses are antigenically very different from human H1N1 viruses and therefore vaccines for human seasonal flu would not provide protection from H1N1 swine flu viruses  liul   14 Out breaks among Pigs ulliOutbreaks among pigs normally occur in colder weather months late fall and winter and sometimes with the introduction of new pigs into susceptible herds Studies have shown that the swine flu H1N1 is common throughout pig populations worldwide with 25 percent of animals showing antibody evidence of infection  liul   15 Present Swine Flu strains ulliAt this time there are four main influenza type A virus subtypes that have been isolated in pigs H1N1 H1N2 H3N2 and H3N1 However most of the recently isolated influenza viruses from pigs have been H1N1 viruses  liul   16 How man is exposed ulliMost commonly these cases occur in persons with direct exposure to pigs eg children near pigs at a fair or workers in the swine industry In addition there have been documented cases of one person spreading swine flu to others  liul   17 How  Swine Flu  presents in   Humans ulliThe symptoms of swine flu in people are expected to be similar to the symptoms of regular  human seasonal influenza  and include fever lethargy lack of appetite and coughing Some people with swine flu also have reported runny nose sore throat nausea vomiting and diarrhea  liul   18 Is the eating Pork infects  ulliNo Swine influenza viruses are not transmitted by food You can not get swine influenza from eating pork or pork products Eating properly handled and cooked pork and pork products is safe Cooking pork to an internal temperature of 160F kills the swine flu virus as it does other bacteria and viruses  liul   19 Close proximity with PIGS spread the Infections ulliInfluenza viruses can be directly transmitted from pigs to people and from people to pigs Human infection with flu viruses from pigs are most likely to occur when people are in close proximity to infected pigs such as in pig barns and livestock exhibits housing pigs at fairs Humantohuman transmission of swine flu can also occur  liul   20 How Swine flu spread among Pigs ulliSwine flu viruses are thought to be spread mostly through close contact among pigs and possibly from contaminated objects moving between infected and uninfected pigs Herds with continuous swine flu infections and herds that are vaccinated against swine flu may have sporadic disease or may show only mild or no symptoms of infection  liul   21 Seek emergency medical care  IF    in Children ulliIn children emergency warning signs that need urgent medical attention include  liululliFast breathing or trouble breathing Bluish skin colorNot drinking enough fluids  liululliNot waking up or not interacting  liululliBeing so irritable that the child does not want to be held  liululliFlulike symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough  liululliFever with a rash  liul   22 Adults Need attention if Present with ulliDifficulty breathing or shortness of breath  liululliPain or pressure in the chest or abdomen  liululliSudden dizziness  liululliConfusion  liululliSevere or persistent vomiting  liul   23 Diagnosis ulliTo diagnose swine influenza A infection a respiratory specimen would generally need to be  collected within the first 4 to 5 days of illness  when an infected person is most likely to be shedding virus However some persons especially children may shed virus for 10 days or longer Identification as a swine flu influenza A virus  liul   24 CDC helps in Diagnosis ulliRequires sending the specimen to CDC for laboratory testing as many laboratories in Developing world do not have facilities liul   25 Drugs which are effective in Swine Flu ulliThere are four different antiviral drugs that are licensed for use in the US for the treatment of influenza  Amantidine rimantadine oseltamivir and zanamivir  While most swine influenza viruses have been susceptible to all four drugs liul   26 Drugs proved resistant at Present ulliMost recent swine influenza viruses isolated from humans are  resistant to Amantidine and Rimantadine  liul   27 CDC  recommends at Present ulliCDC recommends the use of  oseltamivir or zanamivir  for the treatment andor prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses  liul   28 How long can an infected person spread swine flu to others    ulliPeople with swine influenza virus infection should be considered potentially contagious as long as they are symptomatic and possible for up to 7 days following illness onset Children especially younger children might potentially be contagious for longer periods  liul   29 How long can viruses live outside the body   ulliWe know that some viruses and bacteria can live 2 hours or longer on surfaces like cafeteria tables doorknobs and desks Frequent hand washing will help you reduce the chance of getting contamination from these common surfaces  liul   30 No Vaccines to Humans But available to PIGS ulliVaccines are available to be given to pigs to prevent swine influenza  There is no vaccine to protect humans from swine flu  The seasonal influenza vaccine will likely help provide partial protection against swine H3N2 but not swine H1N1 viruses  liul   31 Avoid close contact ulliAvoid close contact with people who are sick When you are sick keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too liululliAerosols spread the virus in any environment  liul   32 Stay home when you are sick  ulliIf possible stay home from work school and errands when you are sick You

epidemic in Chennai city  The Swine
flu   The
swine flu is caused by a virus Influenza Type A H1N1
It was identified that the infection came from Swine from Mexico as they are
very close contact with them The modes of transmission are through droplet and
fomites This has an incubation period of 1  7 days to develop symptoms
People spread the infection by cough or sneeze The virus is a fragile virus
and it gets killed as the droplets dried off   The
symptoms include High fever running nose cough shortness of breathing etc  Management
of epidemic  The Swine flu is caused by a H1N1 influenza virus
posed a lot of challenges before the Public Health managers in the city  Following activities are undertaken by the
Corporation of Chennai  if supportLists a  endif Alleviating fear

activities  Alleviating fear among the population particularly among schools  The age distribution of infected individuals showed
that most of infection happened among the age group between 4 years and 16
years Most of they study in schools More over cluster of cases were diagnosed
in some select schools This caused concern among the school authorities Hence
the following activities are undertaken  if supportLists a  endif Guidelines for
identifying and handling the children with suspected illness and managing them
was sent to all the schools  if supportLists b  endif All the school head
masters principles from corporation private and government schools were
sensitized about the infections They were oriented to identifying suspected symptoms  if supportLists c  endif Posters and
pamphlets were developed specific to this epidemic distribution to all those who
attend the classes  if supportLists d  endif Specific
guidelines were read to all the students in the prayer meetings  if supportLists e  endif Daily press
releases were given to reassure the people  Help line  A separate Help line was opened by the Chennai Corporation
1913 Officers were posted round the clock to answer the queries from the
people Every day more than 300 calls were attended by the officers  Sensitization
of the private practitioners      Corporation of Chennai had called all
the Medical Practitioners through news paper and invitations through the
Sanitary Inspectors The response to the call was dramatic In a single day 860
doctors were sensitized about this flu infection The telephone numbers for
assistance were provided to them  Provision
of diagnostic services  Initially the testing was done only at National
Institute of Communicable Disease at New delhi 
The samples were sent to NICD and results were given after two days After some
times there was huge demand for testing for this flu infection and this
necessitated to establish own diagnostic facilities The King Institute was
identified as testing laboratory as they have the RT PCR facility Real Time
Polymerase Chain Reaction Over the period of time the government permitted 5
Private laboratories to test for H1N1 infection later it was expanded to 8  In order to cope up to demand from government
side The Chennai Corporation has established 6 sample collection centers in
Chennai Corporation Area  Provision
of Treatment services  One of most important component was provision of Treatment
Services As of now only Oseltemivir is the drug of
choice and it is being provided only by the Government through Regional
Directorate of Health and Family Welfare The Communicable  Diseases  Hospital was identified
by the Government of India for treating the H1N1 infection One ward was
exclusively allotted for admitting the infected patients Initially the number
of beds allotted for the swine flu was 32 later it was expanded to 200 beds
All the patients who were identified as H1N1 positive were admitted and 5 day
course of Oseltemivir was given Later two more
hospitals were identified to admit and treat this influenza  Contact
tracing  The disease spread through the droplets and fomites
Most of the droplets gets settled with in one meter of
the index case  Hence Close contacts of
Each of the infected patients was traced to identify the  suspected symptomatic This was a well
coordinated activity among the staff of Public Health Department with support
from Education department for schools  Flow chart for contact tracing  if vml endif     Once
a patient is admitted in Communicable diseases hospital the address and the
details of the cases are intimated to the respective Asst Health Officers and
Sanitary inspectors of the respective division if that patient  is residing within Chennai Corporation
limits If they belong to out side of the city the respective Deputy Directors
of the Health services are informed to do contact tracing   A
detailed epidemiological investigation is being conducted and all the contacts
are being examined for suspected symptoms If any one is found they are given
antibiotics and samples are sent to laboratory The specific treatment is given
once the test result is positive for H1N1    Program Management   The program
management team which consist of The DC Health The
Health Officer and Addl Health Officers was set up This team reviewed all the
reports and monitored the situation on daily basis The epidemiological reports
from the field team were analyzed and suitable instruction was given                            Slideshare uses cookies to improve functionality and performance and to provide you with relevant advertising If you continue browsing the site you agree to the use of cookies on this website See our User Agreement and Privacy Policy   Slideshare uses cookies to improve functionality and performance and to provide you with relevant advertising If you continue browsing the site you agree to the use of cookies on this website See our Privacy Policy and User Agreement for details        SlideShare     Explore     Search     You               Upload    Login    Signup             Submit Search                Home      Explore        Presentation Courses      PowerPoint Courses     by LinkedIn Learning                     Successfully reported this slideshow             We use your LinkedIn profile and activity data to personalize ads and to show you more relevant ads You can change your ad preferences anytime                            Swine Flu                                                                                                                                                                                   Upcoming SlideShare            Loading in  5                    1                   1 of 39                                Like this presentation Why not share   Share  Email                   Swine Flu H1N1 Info Symptoms Prev  by TopDocto  12361 views         Swine flu ppt  by Roses3  25724 views         road safety  by Priyanka Sahay  347 views         Swine flu  by Priyanka Sahay  370 views         Swine Flu  by Freelance clinica  35535 views         H1N1 Virus PowerPoint  by guest8c7d81  29260 views               Share SlideShare         Facebook      Twitter      LinkedIn       Embed     Size px     Start on      Show related SlideShares at end      WordPress Shortcode     Link                            Swine Flu     6221 views       Share    Like    Download                              DrMPrasad Naidu  Assistant Professor at Narayana Medical College Nellore      Follow                      Published on Jan 11 2015       TYPES TRANSMISSION TREATMENT AND PREVENTION           Published in  Health  Medicine        0 Comments      5 Likes      Statistics     Notes                Full Name       Comment goes here  12 hours ago    Delete  Reply  Block      Are you sure you want to  Yes  No    Your message goes here                       Post           Be the first to comment                 Suha Al Makki           5 months ago               Garima Rajput            8 months ago               Sameer Lakhani           9 months ago               Larra RomabonCacho    Junior Technical for Swine at Boehringer Ingelheim   at Boehringer Ingelheim     11 months ago               krishna khanal    Medical Doctor at bardiya district hospital   at Medical Doctor     1 year ago         No Downloads      Views   Total views  6221  On SlideShare  0  From Embeds  0  Number of Embeds  2     Actions   Shares  0  Downloads  338  Comments  0  Likes  5     Embeds 0    No embeds         No notes for slide       Swine Flu   1
    SWINE FLUMPRASAD NAIDU
MSc MEDICAL PhD   2  swine influenza viruses are usually
introduced into a herd by an
infected pig
 In a newly infected herd up to
100 of the animals may become
ill but most animals recover
within 37 days if there are no
secondary bacterial infections or
other complications   3  In uncomplicated cases the case
fatality rate ranges from less than 1
to 4
 Many infections in enzootically
infected herds are subclinical typical
signs of influenza may occur in only
25 to 30 of the pigs   4 Swine influenza also
called pig influenza swine
flu hog flu and pig flu is an
infection caused by any
one of several types of
swine influenza viruses   5 Swine influenza virus SIV
or swineorigin influenza virus S
OIV is any strain of the influenza
family of viruses that
is endemic in pigs As of 2009 the
known SIV strains include influenza
C and the subtypes of influenza
A known as H1N1 H1N2
H2N1 H3N1 H3N2 and H2N3   6 STRUCTURE   7 ELECTRON MICROSCOPE IMAGE OF THE REASSORTED H1N1
INFLUENZA VIRUS PHOTOGRAPHED AT THE CDC INFLUENZA
LABORATORY THE VIRUSES ARE 80120 NANOMETRES IN DIAMETER   8 The influenza virion is roughly spherical It
is an enveloped virus the outer layer is a
lipid membrane which is taken from the
host cell in which the virus multiplies
Inserted into the lipid membrane are
spikes which are proteins  actually
glycoproteins because they consist of
protein linked to sugars  known as HA
hemagglutinin and NA neuraminidase   9 These are the proteins that
determine the subtype of influenza
virus AH1N1 for example
The HA and NA are important in the
immune response against the virus
antibodies proteins made to
combat infection against these
spikes may protect against
infection   10 The NA protein is the target of
the antiviral drugs Relenza and
Tamiflu
Also embedded in the lipid
membrane is the M2 protein
which is the target of
the antiviral adamantanes ama
ntadine and rimantadine   11 Swine influenza virus is common
throughout pig populations worldwide
Transmission of the virus from pigs to
humans is not common and does not
always lead to human flu often resulting
only in the production of antibodies in
the blood If transmission does cause
human flu it is called zoonotic swine flu
People with regular exposure to pigs are
at increased risk of swine flu infection   12 Identification of influenza subtypes
became possible allowing accurate
diagnosis of transmission to
humans Since then only 50 such
transmissions have been confirmed
These strains of swine flu rarely
pass from human to human   13 US PRESIDENT FORD RECEIVES A SWINE FLU
VACCINATION   14 SYMPTOMS   15 People who have swine flu
can be contagious one day
before they have any
symptoms and as many as 7
days after they get sick
Kids can be contagious for
as long as 10 days   16 Symptoms of zoonotic swine flu
in humans are similar to those
of influenza and of influenzalike
illness in general
namely chills fever sore
throatmusclepains
coughingweakness
severe headache and general   17  H1N1 flu is also known as swine
flu Its called swine flu because in
the past the people who caught it
had direct contact with pigs
 That changed several years ago
when a new virus emerged that
spread among people who hadnt
been near pigs   18 CAUSES
OF
SWINE FLU   19 Swine flu is contagious and it
spreads in the same way as
the seasonal flu
 When people who have
it cough or sneeze they spray
tiny drops of the virus into the
air   20  If you come in contact with these
drops or touch a surface such as a
doorknob or sink that an infected
person has recently touched you
can catch H1N1 swine flu
 Despite the name you cant catch
swine flu from eating bacon ham
or any other pork product   21 DIAGNOSIS   22 The CDC recommends real
time PCR as the method of
choice for diagnosing H1N1
The oral or nasal fluid
collection and RNA virus
preserving filter paper card
is commercially available   23 This method allows a
specific diagnosis of novel
influenza H1N1 as
opposed to seasonal
influenza
Nearpatient pointofcare
tests are in development   24 PREVENTION   25 Prevention of swine influenza
has three components
1 prevention in swine
2 prevention of transmission to
humans and
3 prevention of its spread
among humans   26 Thermal imaging camera and screen photographed in an airport terminal in Greece  thermal
imaging can detect elevated body temperature one of the signs of the virus H1N1 swine
influenza   27 THERMAL SCANNING OF PASSENGERS ARRIVING AT SINGAPORE CHANGI AIRPORT   28 Vaccination flu pandemic vaccine
Vaccines are available for different kinds of
swine flu The US Food and Drug
Administration FDA approved the new swine
flu vaccine for use in the United States on
September 15 2009
Studies by the National Institutes of
Health show a single dose creates enough
antibodies to protect against the virus within
about 10 days   29 TREATMENT   30 In swine
As swine influenza is rarely fatal to
pigs little treatment beyond rest
and supportive care is required
Instead veterinary efforts are
focused on preventing the spread of
the virus throughout the farm or to
other farms   31 Vaccination and animal management
techniques are most important in
these efforts
Antibiotics are also used to treat this
disease which although they have no
effect against the influenza virus do
help prevent bacterial pneumonia and
other secondary infections in influenza
weakened herds   32 In humans
If a person becomes sick with
swine flu antiviral drugs can
make the illness milder and
make the patient feel better
faster
They may also prevent serious
flu complications   33 For treatment antiviral drugs work
best if started soon after getting sick
within two days of symptoms
Beside antivirals supportive care at
home or in a hospital focuses on
controlling fevers relieving pain and
maintaining fluid balance as well as
identifying and treating any secondary
infections or other medical problems   34 The US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention recommends the use of oseltamivir
Tamiflu or zanamivir Relenza for the
treatment andor prevention of infection with
swine influenza viruses however the majority
of people infected with the virus make a full
recovery without requiring medical attention or
antiviral drugs
The virus isolated in the 2009 outbreak have
been found resistant
to amantadine and rimantadine
I   35 n the US on April 27 2009 the FDA
issued Emergency Use Authorizations to
available Relenza and Tamiflu antiviral
drugs make to treat the swine influenza
virus in cases for which they are currently
unapproved
The agency issued these EUAs to allow
treatment of patients younger than the
current approval allows and to allow the
widespread distribution of the drugs
including by volunteers   36 THANK

Swine Flu Swine Flu People thought this deadly virus was a sort of human flu disease During 1918 pigs used to fall ill same like humans which were quite normal But since few years swine influenza strain was actually known as H1N1 virus Lets have a look at how exactly this virus spread since past few years Since 5 years between 1997 till 2002 there were new strains of swine influenza which emerged and also gave birth to three different subtypes along with five different genotypes H1N1 form of Swine flu is a deadly virus that caused 1918 flu pandemic which is a matter of concern Not just this but the virus which were found in pigs started circulating in human body as well Government Initiatives Government of India has played a major role in eradicating Swine Flu from India They have placed a prior order for enhancing stock of diagnostic kits and they should be supplied directly to the lab The labs will also provide extra testing facilities for Swine Flu Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme is a new initiative which is being used for testing H1N1 influenza in human body   To enhance the services in a better way Government of India has purchased 60000 Oseltamivir medicines along with 10000 N95 masks Not just this even the NCDC has passed an additional tender for 10000 diagnostic kits According to the Government of India communicating and other awareness programs will create awakeness among the masses Homoeopathy for Swine Flu Department of AYUSH the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy says that homeopathy can help to fight the deadly virus Swine Flu could be eliminated and fought with homoeopathic medicine Arsenicum as shoulb be taken as prophylactic medicine Further they also added and said the medicine contains Arsenicum album 30 one dose 4pills of size 30 by adults and 2 pills by children daily on empty stomach for 3 daysThe course of medicine should be repeated and also followed after one month with the same manner if at all an

Conditions    Swine flu H1N1 flu    Sections Symptoms  causes Diagnosis  treatment Care at Mayo Clinic      Print    Overview Technically the term swine flu refers to influenza in pigs Occasionally pigs transmit influenza viruses to people mainly to hog farmers and veterinarians Less often someone infected with swine flu passes the infection to others  In the spring of 2009 scientists recognized a particular strain of flu virus known as H1N1 This virus is actually a combination of viruses from pigs birds and humans During the 200910 flu season H1N1 caused the respiratory infection in humans that was commonly referred to as swine flu Because so many people around the world got sick that year the World Health Organization declared the flu caused by H1N1 to be a global pandemic  In August 2010 the World Health Organization declared the pandemic over Since that time scientists have changed the way they name viruses The H1N1 virus is now known as H1N1v The v stands for variant and indicates that the virus normally circulates in animals but has been detected in humans Since 2011 another strain H3N2v has been circulating in humans and also causes the flu Both strains are included in the flu vaccine for 201819      Symptoms The signs and symptoms of swine flu are similar to those of infections caused by other flu strains and can include   Fever but not always  Chills  Cough  Sore throat  Runny or stuffy nose  Watery red eyes  Body aches  Headache  Fatigue  Diarrhea  Nausea and vomiting   Flu symptoms develop about one to three days after youre exposed to the virus  When to see a doctor  Its not necessary to see a doctor if youre generally healthy and develop flu signs and symptoms such as fever cough and body aches Call your doctor however if you have flu symptoms and youre pregnant or you have a chronic disease such as asthma emphysema diabetes or a heart condition because you have a higher risk of complications from the flu  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Influenza viruses infect the cells that line your nose throat and lungs The virus enters your body when you inhale contaminated droplets or transfer live virus from a contaminated surface to your eyes nose or mouth  You cant catch swine flu from eating pork  Risk factors If youve lived in or traveled to an area where many people are affected by swine flu you may have been exposed to the virus  Swine farmers and veterinarians have the highest risk of exposure to true swine flu because they work with and are near pigs  Complications Influenza complications include   Worsening of chronic conditions such as heart disease and asthma  Pneumonia  Neurological signs and symptoms ranging from confusion to seizures  Respiratory failure   Prevention The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone age 6 months or older Flu vaccines for 201819 protect against the viruses that cause swine flu and one or two other viruses that are expected to be the most common during flu season  The vaccine is available as an injection or a nasal spray The nasal spray is approved for use in healthy people 2 through 49 years of age who are not pregnant The nasal spray isnt recommended for some groups such as pregnant women children between 2 and 4 years old with asthma or wheezing and people who have compromised immune systems  These measures also help prevent flu and limit its spread   Stay home if youre sick If you have the flu you can give it to others Stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone  Wash your hands thoroughly and frequently Use soap and water or if theyre unavailable use an alcoholbased hand sanitizer  Contain your coughs and sneezes Cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough Wear a face mask if you have one To avoid contaminating your hands cough or sneeze into a tissue or the inner crook of your elbow  Avoid contact Stay away from crowds if possible And if youre at high risk of complications from the flu  for example youre younger than 5 or youre 65 or older youre pregnant or you have a chronic medical condition such as asthma  consider avoiding swine barns at seasonal fairs and elsewhere               By Mayo Clinic Staff    Swine flu H1N1 flu care at Mayo Clinic   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Diagnosis  treatment  Jan 10 2019  Print   Share on

Symptoms  How Do You Prevent Swine Flu  What Are the Complications of Swine Flu  Variant Influenza Virus Swine Flu Symptoms Topic Guide    What Is Swine Flu  Not infrequently there is a news report of another outbreak of swine flu  where a type of influenza A that normally infects pigs crosses over and infects a human Actually however swine flu  no longer exists since the infection is now called a variant influenza virus infection The type of virus is often named based on its genetic makeup  People remember H1N1 from the news but there are three different variants that have been recognized in recent years H1N1 H1N2 and H3N2 As a reminder many types of viruses can cause very similar symptoms that are called influenza or the flu Swine Flu Symptoms  Variant influenza virus symptoms may include all those included in a regular influenzalike disease including fever  cough  sore throat  chills body aches and fatigue  However with the variant virus some patients may also experience more nausea  vomiting  and diarrhea than the seasonal flu but this is not the case for every patient Aside from the nausea vomiting diarrhea  and chills these symptoms sound similar to the symptoms of a severe cold  Whether thats all there is or whether a person will become significantly ill is difficult to predict However individuals with poor or altered immune systems such as infants pregnant women the elderly those undergoing chemotherapy treatment or taking medications that impair immunity are at higher risk for more severe illness But even healthy people can become sick The virus spreads by aerosol droplets meaning that secretions from an infected person can be spread into the air by coughing or sneezing Its the close contact with an ill person that causes the disease to spread We live in a very social society We ride public transportation we attend school and we work with many people Its sometimes hard to know whom to avoid since a person may be contagious for 24 hours before their first symptoms occur Fortunately we have learned how to limit the spread and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC has established monitoring programs looking for the first sign that an epidemic might be on the horizon How a community a hospital or an individual deals with the potential for infection will help decide how fast and how far it will spread Preventing the spread of illness begins with decreasing contact with other people For example at the onset of the H1N1 flu outbreak in the spring of 2009 Mexico had soccer games played in empty stadiums and public transportation was curtailed Schools were closed in New York City San Antonio and San Diego after children who had traveled to Mexico on vacation returned with the swine flu infection Travel advisories worldwide were posted to avoid not only Mexico but also the US and Canada Most schools health care centers and businesses have action plans in place for individuals who may have an infection whether it is a cold vomiting diarrhea or a skin infection For people with upper respiratory tract infections like influenza recommendations include staying home from work or school if you are ill and not returning to school or work until you have been free of fever 100 F or 377 C for 24 hours without taking feverreducing medication During flu season hospitals have plans developed to isolate patients who may be complaining of flulike illnesses whether the symptoms are due to regular or variant influenza Patients may be placed in isolated rooms and made to wear surgical masks until they are examined and screened to make certain that influenza is not the cause of their illness This might become a significant burden on hospitals and clinics if too many people show up to be seen Imagine what would happen if waiting rooms were overwhelmed with coughing people It would be difficult to isolate each one How Do You Prevent Swine Flu  People need to remain calm in the face of a constant barrage of press releases that act as a scoreboard for where and how many influenza cases have been found Remember that the large majority of people infected with variant influenza virus infections around the world have done well without medication Nonetheless it pays to be prepared as follows If there are cases of variant virus flu in the area prevention starts with avoiding crowds of people Other prevention issues are mostly common sense such as good hand washing practices avoid touching the face mouth nose and eyes with your hands and getting plenty of rest and fluids to maintain a strong immune system If symptoms do begin it is worthwhile contacting your family physician health department or local hospital to ask what to do Staying at home and preventing disease spread to others is the first step Advice about supportive care such as fluids and fever control measures may be given by phone Prescription medication for oseltamivir  Tamiflu  or zanamivir  Relenza  antiviral medications that can treat variant virus and regular flu may be also prescribed but some health care practitioners may want to examine a patient before prescribing these drugs What Are the Complications of Swine Flu  Influenza may cause some people to become very ill Dehydration and pneumonia are major complications of influenza Regardless of the altruism of not exposing other people to infection sick people should seek medical care if it is needed Guidelines have been spelled out clearly by the CDC and how they apply to various groups Weve learned how to minimize the spread of influenza epidemics but as the events of 2009 fade from our memory we need to remember that influenza both regular and variant is not something to ignore     From    Cold and Flu Resources   Can

November 2018                         fran ais             espa ol               Key facts   Humans can be infected with avian swine and other zoonotic influenza viruses such as avian influenza virus subtypes AH5N1 AH7N9 and AH9N2 and swine influenza virus subtypes AH1N1 AH1N2 and AH3N2  Human infections are primarily acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans  Avian swine and other zoonotic influenza virus infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection fever and cough early sputum production and rapid progression to severe pneumonia sepsis with shock acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death Conjunctivitis gastrointestinal symptoms encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported to varying degrees depending on subtype  The majority of human cases of influenza A H5N1 and AH7N9 virus infection have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry Controlling the disease in the animal source is critical to decrease risk to humans  Influenza viruses with the vast silent reservoir in aquatic birds are impossible to eradicate Zoonotic influenza infection in humans will continue to occur To minimize public health risk quality surveillance in both animal and human populations thorough investigation of every human infection and riskbased pandemic planning are essential     Humans can be infected with zoonotic influenza viruses such as avian or swine influenza viruses  The pathogen   There are four types of influenza viruses types A B C and D   Influenza A viruses infect humans and many different animals The emergence of a new and very different influenza A virus with the ability infect people and have sustained human to human transmission can cause an influenza pandemic  Influenza B viruses circulates among humans and cause seasonal epidemics Recent data showed seals also can be infected  Influenza C viruses can infect both humans and pigs but infections are generally mild and are rarely reported  Influenza D viruses primarily affect cattle and are not known to infect or cause illness in people    Influenza type A viruses are of most significance to public health due to their potential to cause an influenza pandemic Influenza type A viruses are classified into subtypes according to the combinations of different virus surface proteins hemagglutinin HA and neuraminidase NA So far there are 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes Depending on the origin host influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza swine influenza or other types of animal influenza viruses Examples include avian influenza bird flu virus subtypes AH5N1 and AH9N2 or swine influenza swine flu virus subtypes AH1N1 and AH3N2 All of these animal influenza type A viruses are distinct from human influenza viruses and do not easily transmit among humans  Aquatic birds are the primary natural reservoir for most subtypes of influenza A viruses Most cause asymptomatic or mild infection in birds where the range of symptoms depends on the virus properties Viruses that cause severe disease in poultry and result in high death rates are called highly pathogenic avian influenza HPAI Viruses that cause mild disease in poultry are called low pathogenic avian influenza LPAI  Signs and symptoms in humans   Avian swine and other zoonotic influenza infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory infection fever and cough to rapid progression to severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome shock and even death Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea has been reported more frequently in AH5N1 infection Conjunctivitis has also been reported in influenza AH7 Disease features such as the incubation period severity of symptoms and clinical outcome varies by the virus causing infection but mainly manifests with respiratory symptoms  In many patients infected by AH5 or AH7N9 avian influenza viruses the disease has an aggressive clinical course Common initial symptoms are high fever greater than or equal to 38C and cough followed by symptoms of lower respiratory tract involvement including dyspnoea or difficulty breathing Upper respiratory tract symptoms such as sore throat or coryza are less common Other symptoms such as diarrhea vomiting abdominal pain bleeding from the nose or gums encephalitis and chest pain have also been reported in the clinical course of some patients Complications of infection include severe pneumonia hypoxemic respiratory failure multiorgan dysfunction septic shock and secondary bacterial and fungal infections The case fatality rate for AH5 and AH7N9 subtype virus infections among humans is much higher than that of seasonal influenza infections  For human infections with avian influenza AH7N7 and AH9N2 viruses disease is typically mild or subclinical Only one fatal AH7N7 human infection has been reported in the Netherlands so far For human infections with swine influenza viruses most cases have been mild with a few cases hospitalized and very few reports of deaths resulting from infection  Epidemiology of human infections   In terms of transmission  human infections with avian and other zoonotic influenza viruses though rare have been reported sporadically Human infections are primarily acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments but do not result in efficient transmission of these viruses between people  In 1997 human infections with the HPAI AH5N1 virus were reported during an outbreak in poultry in Hong Kong SAR China Since 2003 this avian virus has spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become endemic in poultry populations in some countries Outbreaks have resulted in millions of poultry infections several hundred human cases and many human deaths The outbreaks in poultry have seriously impacted livelihoods the economy and international trade in affected countries Other avian influenza AH5 subtype viruses have also resulted in both outbreaks in poultry and human infections  In 2013 human infections with AH7N9 virus were reported for the first time in China Since then the virus has spread in the poultry population across the country and resulted in over 1500 reported human cases and many human deaths  Other avian influenza viruses have resulted in sporadic human infections including the AH7N7 and AH9N2 viruses Some countries have also reported sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses  particularly the AH1 and AH3 subtypes  In term of risk factors for human infections   for avian influenza viruses  the primary risk factor for human infection appears to be direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments such as live bird markets Slaughtering defeathering handling carcasses of infected poultry and preparing poultry for consumption especially in household settings are also likely to be risk factors There is no evidence to suggest that the AH5 AH7N9 or other avian influenza viruses can be transmitted to humans through properly prepared poultry or eggs A few influenza AH5N1 human cases have been linked to consumption of dishes made with raw contaminated poultry blood Controlling the circulation of avian influenza viruses in poultry is essential to reducing the risk of human infection Given the persistence of the AH5 and AH7N9 viruses in some poultry populations control will require longterm commitments from countries and strong coordination between animal and public health authorities  for swine influenza viruses  risk factors reported for most human cases includes close proximity to infected pigs or visiting locations where pigs are exhibited  but some limited humantohuman transmission has occurred    For avian influenza AH5N1 virus infections in humans current data indicate an incubation period averaging 2 to 5 days and ranging up to 17 days1 For human infections with the AH7N9 virus incubation period ranges from 1 to 10 days with an average of 5 days For both viruses the average incubation period is longer than that for seasonal influenza 2 days For human infections with swine influenza viruses an incubation period of 27 days has been reported  Diagnosis   Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with zoonotic influenza WHO through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System GISRS periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza in humans using molecular eg RTPCR and others methods  Rapid influenza diagnostic tests RIDTs have lower sensitivity compared to PCR and their reliability depends largely on the conditions under which they are used Commercially available RDTs in general cannot provide subtype information RIDTs are sometimes used in clinical settings but their use in detection of zoonotic viruses is limited  Adequate appropriate samples for influenza tests should be taken from patients and processed with diagnostics according to relevant guidance and protocols 1   Treatment   Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs  notably neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir zanamivir can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival however ongoing clinical studies are needed Emergence of oseltamivir resistance has been reported   In suspected and confirmed cases neuraminidase inhibitors should be prescribed as soon as possible ideally within 48 hours following symptom onset to maximize therapeutic benefits However given the significant mortality currently associated with AH5 and AH7N9 subtype virus infections and evidence of prolonged viral replication in these diseases administration of the drug should also be considered in patients presenting later in the course of illness  Treatment is recommended for a minimum of 5 days but can be extended until there is satisfactory clinical improvement  Corticosteroids should not be used routinely unless indicated for other reasons eg asthma and other specific conditions as it has been associated with prolonged viral clearance immunosuppression leading to bacterial or fungal superinfection  Most recent AH5 and AH7N9 viruses are resistant to adamantane antiviral drugs eg amantadine and rimantadine and are therefore not recommended for monotherapy  Presence of coinfection with bacterial pathogens can be encountered in critically ill patients   Prevention   Apart from antiviral treatment the public health management includes personal protective measures like   Regular hand washing with proper drying of the hands  Good respiratory hygiene  covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing using tissues and disposing of them correctly  Early selfisolation of those feeling unwell feverish and having other symptoms of influenza  Avoiding close contact with sick people  Avoiding touching ones eyes nose or mouth    Health care workers preforming aerosol generating procedures should use airborne precautions Standard contact and droplet precautions and appropriate personal protective equipment PPE should be made available and used during epidemics  Travelers to countries and people living in countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should if possible avoid poultry farms contact with animals in live poultry markets entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals Good food safety and food hygiene practices eg hands washing with soap and water should be followed Travelers returning from affected regions should report to local health services if respiratory symptoms suspecting zoonotic influenza virus infection  Preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis with antivirals is possible but depends on several factors eg individual factors type of exposure and risk associated with the exposure  Pandemic potential   Influenza pandemics are epidemics that affect a large proportion of the world due to a novel virus Pandemics are unpredictable but recurring events that can have health economic and social consequences worldwide An influenza pandemic occurs when a novel influenza virus emerges with the ability to cause sustained humantohuman transmission and the human population has little to no immunity against the virus With the growth of global travel a pandemic can spread rapidly globally with little time to prepare a public health response  Ongoing circulation of some avian influenza viruses in poultry such as AH5 and AH7 viruses are of public health concern as these viruses cause severe disease in humans and the viruses have the potential to mutate to increase transmissibility among humans To date although humantohuman transmission of these viruses is thought to have occurred in some instances when there had been close or prolonged contact with a patient there has been no sustained humantohuman transmission identified  Whether currentlycirculating avian swine and other zoonotic influenza viruses will result in a future pandemic is unknown However the diversity of zoonotic influenza viruses that have caused human infections is alarming and necessitates strengthened surveillance in both animal and human populations thorough investigation of every zoonotic infection and pandemic preparedness planning  WHO response   WHO in its capacity for providing leadership on global health matters continuously monitors avian and other zoonotic influenza viruses closely through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System GISRS WHO in collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health OIE and the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO conducts surveillance at the humananimal interface assesses the associated risks and coordinates response to zoonotic influenza outbreaks and other threats to public health  Based on risk assessment WHO provides guidance develops and adjusts surveillance preparedness and response strategies to influenza  seasonal zoonotic and pandemic influenza and communicates timely risk assessment outcomes and intervention recommendations with Member States to enhance preparedness and response nationally and globally   1 Control of Communicable Diseases Manual 20th Edition American Public Health Association 2015 APHA Press Washington

Rhinitis  in Pigs  Mycoplasmal Pneumonia  in Pigs  Necrotic Rhinitis  in Pigs  Pasteurellosis  in Pigs  Pleuropneumonia  in Pigs  Swine Influenza          Swine influenza is an acute highly contagious respiratory disease that results from infection with type A influenza virus Field isolates of variable virulence exist and clinical manifestation may be determined by secondary organisms Pigs are the principal hosts of classic swine influenza virus Human infections have been reported but porcine strains of influenza A do not appear to easily spread in the human population However deaths have occurred in immunocompromised people In 2009 a pandemic strain of H1N1 influenza A virus spread globally it infected people swine and poultry as well as a small number of dogs cats and other animals The disease in swine occurs commonly in the midwestern USA and occasionally in other states Mexico Canada South America Europe including the UK Sweden and Italy Kenya China Japan Taiwan and other parts of eastern Asia      Etiology      Swine influenza virus SIV is an orthomyxovirus of the influenza A group with hemagglutinating antigen H1 and neuraminidase antigen N1 ie H1N1 Recently new subtypes of SIV have been reported H3N2 H1N2 and H2N3 Influenza B and C viruses have been isolated from pigs but have not caused the classic disease The classic type A infection with isolates of mild virulence may favor replication of pseudorabies virus see Pseudorabies  Haemophilus parasuis Gl ssers disease see Glassers Disease  Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae see Pleuropneumonia  in Pigs  and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae see Mycoplasmal Pneumonia  in Pigs  any of which may complicate outbreaks The mixing of carrier and nonimmune pigs is an important predisposing factor The virus is unlikely to survive outside living cells for 2 wk except in cold conditions It is readily inactivated by disinfectants       Transmission and Epidemiology      In North America outbreaks are most common in fall or winter often at the onset of particularly cold weather In warmer areas of the world infection may occur at any time Usually an outbreak is preceded by one or two individual cases and then spreads rapidly within a herd mainly by aerosolization and pigtopig contact The virus survives in carrier pigs for up to 3 mo and can be recovered from clinically healthy animals between outbreaks In antibodypositive herds outbreaks of infection recur as immunity wanes Up to 40 of herds may contain antibodypositive pigs Carrier pigs are usually responsible for the introduction of SIV into previously uninfected herds and countries       Pathogenesis      The spectrum of infection ranges from subclinical to acute In the classic acute form the virus multiplies in bronchial epithelium within 16 hr of infection and causes focal necrosis of the bronchial epithelium focal atelectasis and gross hyperemia of the lungs Bronchial exudates and widespread atelectasis grossly appearing as plumcolored lesions affecting individual lobules of apical and intermediate lobes are seen after 24 hr The lesions continue to develop until 72 hr after infection after which the virus becomes more difficult to demonstrate Losses in reproduction associated with primary outbreaks appear to be secondary because virus has been recovered only rarely from the fetus       Clinical Findings      A classic acute outbreak is characterized by sudden onset and rapid spread through the entire herd often within 13 days The main signs are depression fever to 108F 42C anorexia coughing dyspnea weakness prostration and a mucous discharge from the eyes and nose Mortality is generally 14 The overt course of the disease is usually 37 days in uncomplicated infections with clinical recovery of the herd almost as sudden as the onset However virus may continue to cycle among pigs when clinical signs are suppressed by immune responses Some pigs may become chronically affected In herds that are in good condition the principal economic loss is from stunting and delay in reaching market weight Some increase in piglet mortality has been reported and effects on herd fertility including abortions in late pregnancy may follow outbreaks in nonimmune herds   Lesions   In uncomplicated infections lesions usually are confined to the thoracic cavity The pneumonic areas are clearly demarcated collapsed and purplish red They may be distributed throughout the lungs but tend to be more extensive and confluent ventrally Nonpneumonic areas are pale and emphysematous The airways contain a copious mucopurulent exudate and the bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes are edematous but rarely congested There may be severe pulmonary edema especially of interlobular septae or a serous or serofibrinous pleuritis Histologically the lesions when fully developed are primarily those of an exudative bronchiolitis with some interstitial pneumonia        Diagnosis      A presumptive diagnosis can be made on clinical and pathologic findings but confirmation depends on detection of viral RNA via PCR molecular sequencing or demonstration of virusspecific antibody Virus can be isolated from nasal secretions in the febrile phase or from affected lung tissue in the early acute stage A retrospective diagnosis can be made by demonstrating a rise in virusspecific antibodies in acute and convalescent serum samples using the hemagglutination inhibition test Both H3 and H1 subtype antigens should be included This test is also used for herd surveys To diagnose uncomplicated influenza infection conditions such as pasteurellosis pseudorabies porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and chlamydial and Haemophilus infections must be excluded       Treatment and Control      There is no effective treatment although antimicrobials may reduce secondary bacterial infections Expectorants may help relieve signs in severely affected herds Vaccination and strict import controls are the only specific preventive measures Good management practices and freedom from stress particularly due to crowding and dust help reduce losses Commercially available killed vaccines that contain both H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes appear to induce a strong protective immune response             Respiratory Diseases of Pigs  Overview of Respiratory Diseases of Pigs  Atrophic Rhinitis  in Pigs  Mycoplasmal Pneumonia  in Pigs

administration of Influenza A H1N1 2009 Monovalent Vaccine with other
vaccines If Influenza A H1N1 2009 Monovalent Vaccine is to be given at the
same time as another injectable vaccines the vaccines should be
administered at different injection sites  Influenza A H1N1 2009 Monovalent Vaccine should not be
mixed with any other vaccine in the same syringe or vial  Concurrent Use With Immunosuppressive Therapies  The immunological response to Influenza A H1N1 2009
Monovalent Vaccine may be diminished in individuals receiving corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapies  Use In Specific Populations  CSLs Influenza A H1N1 2009 Monovalent Vaccine and

have not been conducted with Influenza A H1N1 2009 Monovalent Vaccine or
AFLURIA It is also not known whether these vaccines can cause fetal harm when
administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity Influenza
A H1N1 2009 Monovalent Vaccine should be given to a pregnant woman only if
clearly needed  Nursing Mothers  Neither Influenza A H1N1 2009 Monovalent Vaccine nor
AFLURIA has been evaluated in nursing mothers It is not known whether
Influenza A H1N1 2009 Monovalent Vaccine or AFLURIA is excreted in human
milk Because many drugs are excreted in human milk caution should be
exercised when Influenza A H1N1 2009 Monovalent Vaccine is administered to a
nursing woman  Pediatric Use  Safety and effectiveness of Influenza A H1N1 2009
Monovalent Vaccine and AFLURIA in children below 6 months of age have not been
established The safety and immunogenicity of AFLURIA was evaluated in 298
children between the ages of 6 months and 9 years see ADVERSE REACTIONS and Clinical Studies   Geriatric Use  In four clinical studies 343 subjects ages 65 years and
older received AFLURIA Hemagglutinationinhibiting antibody responses in
geriatric subjects were lower after administration of AFLURIA in comparison to
younger adult subjects see Clinical Studies  Adverse event rates were
generally similar in frequency to those reported in subjects ages 18 to less
than 65 years although some differences were observed see ADVERSE

influenza is an infection caused by any one of several types of swine influenza  viruses  Swine influenza virus  SIV  or swineorigin influenza virus  SOIV  is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs   4  As of 2009 the known SIV strains include influenza C and the subtypes of influenza A known as H1N1  H1N2  H2N1 H911 H3N1  H3N2  and H2N3   The Swine flu was initially seen in humans in Mexico in 2009 where the strand of the particular virus was a marriage of 3 types of strands  178  Six of the genes are very similar to the H1N2 influenza virus that was found in pigs around 2000  178    Swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human flu  often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood If transmission does cause human flu it is called zoonotic swine flu People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection  Around the mid20th century identification of influenza subtypes became possible allowing accurate diagnosis of transmission to humans Since then only 50 such transmissions have been confirmed These strains of swine flu rarely pass from human to human Symptoms of zoonotic swine flu in humans are similar to those of influenza and of influenzalike illness in general namely chills  fever  sore throat  muscle pains  severe headache  coughing  weakness  shortness of breath and general discomfort   In August 2010 the World Health Organization declared the swine flu pandemic officially over  179    180    Cases of swine flu have been reported in India  with over 31156 positive test cases and 1841 deaths up to March 2015  8     Signs and symptoms    Swine   In Swine an influenza infection produces fever  lethargy  sneezing  coughing  difficulty breathing and decreased appetite  182  In some cases the infection can cause abortion  Although mortality is usually low around 14  4  the virus can produce weight loss and poor growth  causing economic loss to farmers  182  Infected pigs can lose up to 12 pounds of body weight over a three to fourweek period  182  Swine have receptors to which both avian and mammalian influenza viruses are able to bind to which leads to the virus being able to evolve and mutate into different forms  186  Influenza A is responsible for infecting swine and was first identified in the summer of 1918  186  Pigs have often been seen as mixing vessels which help to change and evolve strains of disease that are then passed on to other mammals such as humans  186     Humans     Direct transmission of a swine flu virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible  zoonotic swine flu In all 50 cases are known to have occurred since the first report in medical literature in 1958 which have resulted in a total of six deaths  188  Of these six people one was pregnant one had leukemia  one had Hodgkins lymphoma and two were known to be previously healthy  188  Despite these apparently low numbers of infections the true rate of infection may be higher since most cases only cause a very mild disease and will probably never be reported or diagnosed  188         In this video Dr Joe Bresee with CDCs Influenza Division describes the symptoms of swine flu and warning signs to look for that indicate the need for urgent medical attention See also See this video with subtitles on YouTube  173     According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC in humans the symptoms of the 2009 swine flu H1N1 virus are similar to those of influenza and of influenzalike illness in general Symptoms include fever  cough  sore throat  watery eyes body aches shortness of breath headache  weight loss chills  sneezing runny nose coughing dizziness abdominal pain lack of appetite and fatigue  The 2009 outbreak has shown an increased percentage of patients reporting diarrhea and vomiting as well The 2009 H1N1 virus is not zoonotic swine flu as it is not transmitted from pigs to humans but from person to person through airborne droplets  Because these symptoms are not specific to swine flu a differential diagnosis of probable swine flu requires not only symptoms but also a high likelihood of swine flu due to the persons recent and past medical history For example during the 2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States  the CDC advised physicians to consider swine influenza infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute febrile respiratory illness who have either been in contact with persons with confirmed swine flu or who were in one of the five US states that have reported swine flu cases or in Mexico during the seven days preceding their illness onset A diagnosis of confirmed swine flu requires laboratory testing of a respiratory sample a simple nose and throat swab  The most common cause of death is respiratory failure  Other causes of death are pneumonia leading to sepsis   173  high fever leading to neurological problems dehydration from excessive vomiting and diarrhea  electrolyte imbalance and kidney failure  Fatalities are more likely in young children and the elderly   Virology    Transmission    Between pigs   Influenza is quite common in pigs with about half of breeding pigs having been exposed to the virus in the US  98  Antibodies to the virus are also common in pigs in other countries  98    The main route of transmission is through direct contact between infected and uninfected animals  182  These close contacts are particularly common during animal transport Intensive farming may also increase the risk of transmission as the pigs are raised in very close proximity to each other  173    173  The direct transfer of the virus probably occurs either by pigs touching noses or through dried mucus Airborne transmission through the aerosols produced by pigs coughing or sneezing are also an important means of infection  182  The virus usually spreads quickly through a herd infecting all the pigs within just a few days  4  Transmission may also occur through wild animals such as wild boar  which can spread the disease between farms  173     To humans   People who work with poultry and swine especially those with intense exposures are at increased risk of zoonotic infection with influenza virus endemic in these animals and constitute a population of human hosts in which zoonosis and reassortment can cooccur  191  Vaccination of these workers against influenza and surveillance for new influenza strains among this population may therefore be an important public health measure  193  Transmission of influenza from swine to humans who work with swine was documented in a small surveillance study performed in 2004 at the University of Iowa This study among others forms the basis of a recommendation that people whose jobs involve handling poultry and swine be the focus of increased public health surveillance  191  Other professions at particular risk of infection are veterinarians and meat processing workers although the risk of infection for both of these groups is lower than that of farm workers  199     Interaction with avian H5N1 in pigs   Pigs are unusual as they can be infected with influenza strains that usually infect three different species pigs birds and humans This makes pigs a host where influenza viruses might exchange genes producing new and dangerous strains Avian influenza virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains  202   H3N2 evolved from H2N2 by antigenic shift   205  In August 2004 researchers in China found H5N1 in pigs  24         These H5N1 infections may be quite common in a survey of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in West Java  where avian flu had broken out five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus The Indonesian government has since found similar results in the same region Additional tests of 150 pigs outside the area were negative  56    48     Structure   The influenza virion is roughly spherical It is an enveloped virus the outer layer is a lipid membrane which is taken from the host cell in which the virus multiplies Inserted into the lipid membrane are spikes which are proteinsactually glycoproteins because they consist of protein linked to sugarsknown as HA  hemagglutinin  and NA  neuraminidase  These are the proteins that determine the subtype of influenza virus AH1N1 for example The HA and NA are important in the immune response against the virus antibodies proteins made to combat infection against these spikes may protect against infection The NA protein is the target of the antiviral drugs Relenza and Tamiflu  Also embedded in the lipid membrane is the M2 protein  which is the target of the antiviral  adamantanes  amantadine and rimantadine    Classification   Of the three genera of influenza viruses that cause human flu  two also cause influenza in pigs with influenza A being common in pigs and influenza C being rare  400   Influenza B has not been reported in pigs Within influenza A and influenza C the strains found in pigs and humans are largely distinct although because of reassortment there have been transfers of genes among strains crossing swine avian and human species boundaries   Influenza C   Influenza viruses infect both humans and pigs but do not infect birds  210  Transmission between pigs and humans have occurred in the past  213  For example influenza C caused small outbreaks of a mild form of influenza amongst children in Japan  215  and California  215  Because of its limited host range and the lack of genetic diversity in influenza C this form of influenza does not cause pandemics in humans  218     Influenza A   Swine influenza is caused by influenza A subtypes H1N1   61   H1N2   61   H2N3   220   H3N1   223  and H3N2   61  In pigs four influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 H1N2 H3N2 and H7N9 are the most common strains worldwide  182  In the United States  the H1N1 subtype was exclusively prevalent among swine populations before 1998 however since late August 1998 H3N2 subtypes have been isolated from pigs As of 2004 H3N2 virus isolates in US swine and turkey stocks were triple reassortants  containing genes from human HA NA and PB1 swine NS NP and M and avian PB2 and PA lineages  226  In August 2012 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 145 human cases 113 in Indiana 30 in Ohio one in Hawaii and one in Illinois of H3N2v since July 2012  71  The death of a 61yearold Madison County Ohio woman is the first in the nation associated with a new swine flu strain She contracted the illness after having contact with hogs at the Ross County Fair  72     Diagnosis                Main symptoms of swine flu in swine  4       The CDC recommends realtime PCR as the method of choice for diagnosing H1N1  179  The oral or nasal fluid collection and RNA virus preserving filter paper card is commercially available  179  This method allows a specific diagnosis of novel influenza H1N1 as opposed to seasonal influenza  Nearpatient pointofcare tests are in development  179     Prevention   Prevention of swine influenza has three components prevention in pigs prevention of transmission to humans and prevention of its spread among humans   Swine   Methods of preventing the spread of influenza among swine include facility management herd management and vaccination  ATCvet code QI09AA03    Because much of the illness and death associated with swine flu involves secondary infection by other pathogens control strategies that rely on vaccination may be insufficient  Control of swine influenza by vaccination has become more difficult in recent decades as the evolution of the virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the infection when the virus strains match enough to have significant crossprotection and custom autogenous vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases  179    179  Present vaccination strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined only 41 isolates had strong serologic crossreactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses  188    179  The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick it does not block infection or shedding of the virus  179    Facility management includes using disinfectants and ambient temperature to control viruses in the environment They are unlikely to survive outside living cells for more than two weeks except in cold but above freezing conditions and are readily inactivated by disinfectants  4  Herd management includes not adding pigs carrying influenza to herds that have not been exposed to the virus The virus survives in healthy carrier pigs for up to three months and can be recovered from them between outbreaks Carrier pigs are usually responsible for the introduction of SIV into previously uninfected herds and countries so new animals should be quarantined   98  After an outbreak as immunity in exposed pigs wanes new outbreaks of the same strain can occur  4     Humans    Prevention of pigtohuman transmission        Swine can be infected by both avian and human flu strains of influenza and therefore are hosts where the antigenic shifts can occur that create new influenza strains  The transmission from swine to humans is believed to occur mainly in swine farms where farmers are in close contact with live pigs Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans this may occasionally happen so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face masks when dealing with infected animals The use of vaccines on swine to prevent their infection is a major method of limiting swinetohuman transmission Risk factors that may contribute to swinetohuman transmission include smoking and especially not wearing gloves when working with sick animals thereby increasing the likelihood of subsequent handtoeye handtonose or handtomouth transmission  179     Prevention of humantohuman transmission   Influenza spreads between humans when infected people cough or sneeze then other people breathe in the virus or touch something with the virus on it and then touch their own face Avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth Germs spread this way  193  Swine flu cannot be spread by pork products since the virus is not transmitted through food The swine flu in humans is most contagious during the first five days of the illness although some people most commonly children can remain contagious for up to ten days Diagnosis can be made by sending a specimen collected during the first five days for analysis  180                 Thermal scanning of passengers arriving at Singapore Changi airport     Recommendations to prevent spread of the virus among humans include using standard infection control  which includes frequent washing of hands with soap and water or with alcoholbased hand sanitizers  especially after being out in public  180  Chance of transmission is also reduced by disinfecting household surfaces which can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach solution  180    Experts agree handwashing can help prevent viral infections including ordinary and the swine flu infections Also avoiding touching ones eyes nose or mouth with ones hands helps to prevent the flu  193  Influenza can spread in coughs or sneezes but an increasing body of evidence shows small droplets containing the virus can linger on tabletops telephones and other surfaces and be transferred via the fingers to the eyes nose or mouth Alcoholbased gel or foam hand sanitizers work well to destroy viruses and bacteria Anyone with flulike symptoms such as a sudden fever cough or muscle aches should stay away from work or public transportation and should contact a doctor for advice   Social distancing  another tactic is staying away from other people who might be infected and can include avoiding large gatherings spreading out a little at work or perhaps staying home and lying low if an infection is spreading in a community Public health and other responsible authorities have action plans which may request or require social distancing actions depending on the severity of the outbreak   Vaccination    Vaccines are available for different kinds of swine flu The US Food and Drug Administration FDA approved the new swine flu vaccine for use in the United States on September 15 2009  132  Studies by the National Institutes of Health show a single dose creates enough antibodies to protect against the virus within about 10 days  16    In the aftermath of the 2009 pandemic several studies were conducted to see who received influenza vaccines These studies show that whites are much more likely to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza and for the H1N1 strain than African Americans  180  This could be due to several factors Historically there has been mistrust of vaccines and of the medical community from African Americans Many African Americans do not believe vaccines or doctors to be effective This mistrust stems from the exploitation of the African American communities during studies like the Tuskegee study  Additionally vaccines are typically administered in clinics hospitals or doctors offices Many people of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive vaccinations because they do not have health insurance   Surveillance   Although there is no formal national surveillance system in the United States to determine what viruses are circulating in pigs an informal surveillance network in the United States is part of a world surveillance network  180     Treatment    Swine   As swine influenza is rarely fatal to pigs little treatment beyond rest and supportive care is required  98  Instead veterinary efforts are focused on preventing the spread of the virus throughout the farm or to other farms  182  Vaccination and animal management techniques are most important in these efforts Antibiotics are also used to treat this disease which although they have no effect against the influenza virus do help prevent bacterial pneumonia and other secondary infections in influenzaweakened herds  98     Humans   If a person becomes sick with swine flu antiviral drugs can make the illness milder and make the patient feel better faster They may also prevent serious flu complications For treatment antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick within two days of symptoms Beside antivirals supportive care at home or in a hospital focuses on controlling fevers relieving pain and maintaining fluid balance as well as identifying and treating any secondary infections or other medical problems The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of oseltamivir Tamiflu or zanamivir Relenza for the treatment andor prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses however the majority of people infected with the virus make a full recovery without requiring medical attention or antiviral drugs  180  The virus isolated in the 2009 outbreak have been found resistant to amantadine and rimantadine   In the US on April 27 2009 the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations to make available Relenza and Tamiflu  antiviral drugs to treat the swine influenza virus in cases for which they are currently unapproved The agency issued these EUAs to allow treatment of patients younger than the current approval allows and to allow the widespread distribution of the drugs including by volunteers  207     History   Swine influenza was first proposed to be a disease related to human flu during the 1918 flu pandemic  when pigs became ill at the same time as humans  97  The first identification of an influenza virus as a cause of disease in pigs occurred about ten years later in 1930  236  For the following 60 years swine influenza strains were almost exclusively H1N1 Then between 1997 and 2002 new strains of three different subtypes and five different genotypes emerged as causes of influenza among pigs in North America In 19971998 H3N2 strains emerged These strains which include genes derived by reassortment from human swine and avian viruses have become a major cause of swine influenza in North America Reassortment between H1N1 and H3N2 produced H1N2  In 1999 in Canada a strain of H4N6 crossed the species barrier from birds to pigs but was contained on a single farm  236    The H1N1 form of swine flu is one of the descendants of the strain that caused the 1918 flu pandemic   240  As well as persisting in pigs the descendants of the 1918 virus have also circulated in humans through the 20th century contributing to the normal seasonal epidemics of influenza  240  However direct transmission from pigs to humans is rare with only 12 recorded cases in the US since 2005 Nevertheless the retention of influenza strains in pigs after these strains have disappeared from the human population might make pigs a reservoir where influenza viruses could persist later emerging to reinfect humans once human immunity to these strains has waned  Swine flu has been reported numerous times as a zoonosis in humans usually with limited distribution rarely with a widespread distribution Outbreaks in swine are common and cause significant economic losses in industry primarily by causing stunting and extended time to market For example this disease costs the British meat industry about 65 million every year  242     1918 pandemic   The 1918 flu pandemic in humans was associated with H1N1 and influenza appearing in pigs  240  this may reflect a zoonosis either from swine to humans or from humans to swine Although it is not certain in which direction the virus was transferred some evidence suggests in this case pigs caught the disease from humans  97  For instance swine influenza was only noted as a new disease of pigs in 1918 after the first large outbreaks of influenza amongst people  97  Although a recent phylogenetic analysis of more recent strains of influenza in humans birds animals and many others and swine suggests the 1918 outbreak in humans followed a reassortment event within a mammal  244  the exact origin of the 1918 strain remains elusive  246  It is estimated that anywhere from 50 to 100 million people were killed worldwide  240    247     1976 US outbreak   On February 5 1976 a United States army recruit at Fort Dix said he felt tired and weak He died the next day and four of his fellow soldiers were later hospitalized Two weeks after his death health officials announced the cause of death was a new strain of swine flu The strain a variant of H1N1 is known as ANew Jersey1976 H1N1 It was detected only from January 19 to February 9 and did not spread beyond Fort Dix                    This new strain appeared to be closely related to the strain involved in the 1918 flu pandemic Moreover the ensuing increased surveillance uncovered another strain in circulation in the US AVictoria75 H3N2  which spread simultaneously also caused illness and persisted until March Alarmed public health officials decided action must be taken to head off another major pandemic and urged President Gerald Ford that every person in the US be vaccinated for the disease  The vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems  118  On October 1 1976 immunizations began and three senior citizens died soon after receiving their injections This resulted in a media outcry that linked these deaths to the immunizations despite the lack of any proof the vaccine was the cause According to science writer Patrick Di Justo however by the time the truth was knownthat the deaths were not proven to be related to the vaccineit was too late The government had long feared mass panic about swine flunow they feared mass panic about the swine flu vaccinations This became a strong setback to the program  119    There were reports of GuillainBarr  syndrome GBS a paralyzing neuromuscular disorder affecting some people who had received swine flu immunizations Although whether a link exists is still not clear this syndrome may be a side effect of influenza vaccines As a result Di Justo writes the public refused to trust a governmentoperated health program that killed old people and crippled young people In total 48161019 Americans or just over 22 of the population had been immunized by the time the National Influenza Immunization Program was effectively halted on December 16 1976  248    122    Overall there were 1098 cases of GBS recorded nationwide by CDC surveillance 532 of which occurred after vaccination and 543 before vaccination  250  About one to two cases per 100000 people of GBS occur every year whether or not people have been vaccinated The vaccination program seems to have increased this normal risk of developing GBS by about to one extra case per 100000 vaccinations  Recompensation charges were filed for over 4000 cases of severe vaccination damage including 25 deaths totalling US35 billion by 1979  126  The CDC stated most studies on modern influenza vaccines have seen no link with GBS  252    254  Although one review gives an incidence of about one case per million vaccinations  256  a large study in China reported in the  New England Journal of Medicine   covering close to 100 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine found only 11 cases of GBS which is lower than the normal rate of the disease in China The riskbenefit ratio which is what vaccines and everything in medicine is about is overwhelmingly in favor of vaccination  133     1988 US outbreak   In September 1988 a swine flu virus killed one woman and infected others A 32yearold woman Barbara Ann Wieners was eight months pregnant when she and her husband Ed became ill after visiting the hog barn at a county fair in Walworth County Wisconsin  Barbara died eight days later after developing pneumonia  258  The only pathogen identified was an H1N1 strain of swine influenza virus  260  Doctors were able to induce labor and deliver a healthy daughter before she died Her husband recovered from his symptoms   Influenzalike illness ILI was reportedly widespread among the pigs exhibited at the fair Of the 25 swine exhibitors aged 9 to 19 at the fair 19 tested positive for antibodies to SIV but no serious illnesses were seen The virus was able to spread between people since one to three health care personnel who had cared for the pregnant woman developed mild influenzalike illnesses and antibody tests suggested they had been infected with swine flu but there was no community outbreak  262    In 1998 swine flu was found in pigs in four US states Within a year it had spread through pig populations across the United States Scientists found this virus had originated in pigs as a recombinant form of flu strains from birds and humans This outbreak confirmed that pigs can serve as a crucible where novel influenza viruses emerge as a result of the reassortment of genes from different strains  140    4  Genetic components of these 1998 triplehybrid stains would later form six out of the eight viral gene segments in the 2009 flu outbreak  143    145    147    149    151     2007 Philippine outbreak   On August 20 2007 Department of Agriculture officers investigated the outbreak of swine flu in Nueva Ecija and central Luzon  Philippines The mortality rate is less than 10 for swine flu unless there are complications like hog cholera  On July 27 2007 the Philippine National Meat Inspection Service NMIS raised a hog cholera red alert warning over Metro Manila and five regions of Luzon after the disease spread to backyard pig farms in Bulacan and Pampanga  even if these tested negative for the swine flu virus   2009 Northern Ireland outbreak   Since November 2009 14 deaths as a result of swine flu in Northern Ireland have been reported The majority of the victims were reported to have preexisting health conditions which had lowered their immunity This closely corresponds to the 19 patients who had died in the year prior due to swine flu where 18 of the 19 were determined to have lowered immune systems Because of this many mothers who have just given birth are strongly encouraged to get a flu shot because their immune systems are vulnerable Also studies have shown that people between the ages of 15 and 44 have the highest rate of infection Although most people now recover having any conditions that lower ones immune system increases the risk of having the flu become potentially lethal In Northern Ireland now approximately 56 of all people under 65 who are entitled to the vaccine have gotten the shot and the outbreak is said to be under control   2015 and 2017 India outbreaks   Swine flu outbreaks were reported in India in late 2014 and early 2015 As of March 19 2015 the disease has affected 31151 people and claimed over 1841 lives  8  The largest number of reported cases and deaths due to the disease occurred in the western part of India including states like Delhi  Madhya Pradesh  Rajasthan  and Gujarat  Researchers of MIT have claimed that the swine flu has mutated in India to a more virulent version with changes in Hemagglutinin protein This has however been disputed by Indian researchers  173    There was another outbreak in India in 2017 The states of Maharashtra and Gujarat were the most affected states  173  Gujarat high court has given Gujarat government instructions to control deaths by Swine Flu  173  Actor Aamir Khan and wife Kiran Rao were among the latest to be afflicted by swine flu  173  The couple spoke about their battle with the H1N1 virus via video conference at the Satyamev Jayate Water Cup event in Pune  which they had to skip due to illhealth More than 1094 people died of Swine flu in India in year 2017 till 26 August 2017  173     2015 Nepal outbreak   Swine flu outbreaks were reported in Nepal in the spring of 2015 As of April 21 2015 the disease has claimed 26 lives in the most severely affected district Jajarkot in Northwest Nepal  173  Cases were also detected in the districts of Kathmandu  Morang  Kaski  and Chitwan   173  As of 22 April 2015 the Nepal Ministry of Health reported that 2498 people had been treated in Jajarkot of whom 552 were believed to have swine flu and acknowledged that the governments response had been inadequate  173  The Jajarkot outbreak had just been declared an emergency when the April 2015 Nepal earthquake struck on 25 April 2015 diverting all medical and emergency resources to quakerelated rescue and recovery   2016 Pakistan outbreak   There were seven cases of Swine flu reported in Punjab province of Pakistan mainly in the city of Multan in January 2016Cases of Swine Flu have also been reported in Lahore  173     2017 Maldives outbreak   As of 16 March 2017 over a hundred confirmed cases of Swine flu and at least six deaths were reported in the Maldivian capital of Male and some other islands Makeshift flu clinics were opened in Male  173  Schools universities and colleges in the capital were closed prison visitations suspended several events cancelled and all nonessential travel to other islands outside the capital was advised against by the HPA An influenza vaccination program focussed on pregnant women was initiated soon after  173  An official visit by the Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud to the Maldives during his Asian tour was also cancelled last minute amidst fears over the outbreak of swine flu   H1N1 virus pandemic history   A study conducted in 2008 and published in the journal Nature  has managed to establish the evolutionary origin of the flu strain of swine origin SOIV  173    The phylogenetic origin of the flu virus that caused the 2009 pandemics can be traced before 1918 Around 1918 the ancestral virus of avian origin crossed the species boundaries and infected humans as human H1N1 The same phenomenon took place soon after in America where the human virus was infecting pigs it led to the emergence of the H1N1 swine strain which later became the classic swine flu  New events of reassortment were not reported until 1968 when the avian strain H1N1 infected humans again this time the virus met the strain H2N2 and the reassortment originated the strain H3N2 This strain has remained as a stable flu strain until now  The mid1970s were important for the evolution of flu strains First the reemergence of the human H1N1 strain became a seasonal strain Then a small outbreak of swine H1N1 occurred in humans and finally the human H2N2 strain apparently became extinct Around 1979 the avian H1N1 strain infected pigs and gave rise to Euroasiatic swine flu and H1N1 Euroasiatic swine virus which is still being transmitted in swine populations  The critical moment for the 2009 outbreak was between 1990 and 1993 A triple reassortment event in a pig host of North American H1N1 swine virus the human H3N2 virus and avian H1N1 virus generated the swine H1N2 strain Finally the last step in SOIV history was in 2009 when the virus H1N2 coinfected a human host at the same time as the Euroasiatic H1N1 swine strain This led to the emergence of a new human H1N1 strain which caused the 2009 pandemic  On June 11 2009 the World Health Organization raised the worldwide pandemic alert level to Phase 6 for swine flu which is the highest alert level This alert level means that the swine flu had spread worldwide and there were cases of people with the virus in most countries The pandemic level identifies the spread of the disease or virus and not necessarily the severity of the disease  Swine flu spread very rapidly worldwide due to its high humantohuman transmission rate and due to the frequency of air travel  In 2015 the instances of Swine Flu substantially increased to five year highs with over 10000 cases reported and 660 deaths in India  173  The states reporting the highest number of cases and deaths are Rajasthan Gujarat Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra Delhi and Telangana  173  The circulating strain of influenza being the same unmutant strain that caused global pandemic in 2009 A H1N1 pdm 09 the sudden spurt of the cases in the beginning of 2015 left the Indian government unexplained but concerned Government instructed the affected states to investigate into the epidemiological reasons of such spurt in the states and had detailed the advisory guidelines to all states The guidelines are mainly for a description of A H1N1 for prompt identification detection and distinction from the symptoms of other similar infection such as common flucold b categorization of screening of influenza A H1N1 cases c clinical management protocol of Pandemic influenza A H1N1 d providing home care e collection of human sample  173  Besides through the National Centre for Diseases Control NCDC Directorate General of Health Services DGHS Government of India GoI had placed a tender to procure 8 kits of Assay sets 37 kits of one step RTPCR kit and 36 kits of viral RNA extraction kits  173     Notes         International Committee on onomy of Viruses  Archived from on January 13 2010           The Merck Veterinary Manual  2008 ISBN 1442167424  Retrieved April 30

of swine flu vaccine Cities  MidDaycom  Updated August 13 2010 0655 IST  Share EMAIL PRINT COMMENTS Pune A family in Pune was in for a shock when three of its members went to get a shot for swine flu The doctor from Sinhagad Road charged almost Rs 1400 for the vaccine  nearly 10 times the original price and the reason she gave for the high charges was the quality service rendered by her before and while administering the doses On top of that the doctor also squeezed out the last drop of juice from a fivedose vaccine vial by giving six doses from it The actual cost of the vaccine is Rs 150 per dose The doctor justified the charges saying she had taken the risk of testing the vaccine on herself and even argued that giving six doses from a fivedose vial was all right Deepak Kokane a resident of Manikbaug Sinhagad Road said his wife and two children recently went to their paediatrician for H1N1 preventive vaccination The doctor told us the vaccine was available in a fivedose vial and she would give it to my family after she had found two or three other people who wanted to take the vaccine said Kokane On July 25 she called my wife Rupali son Aditya and daughter Khushi to the clinic for vaccination He said that besides his wife and two children the doctor gave the vaccine from the vial to another woman and her two children Firstly how did six people get vaccinated from a fivedose vial said Kokane After the vaccination she told my wife the charges were Rs 1400 per person Kokane said his wife was taken aback by the high charges but was even more surprised by what followed  the doctor virtually held her hostage when she said she did not have enough money on her at that moment My wife had just Rs 1500 on her as we knew the cost of the vaccine to be Rs 150 per dose and that all other clinics were giving it for Rs 250 said Kokane The doctor did not allow my family to leave the clinic until the money she was asking for was brought to her This despite the fact that my family has been going to the clinic for many years NDTV Beeps  your daily newsletter Woman Found Dead In Bed Storage In Gurgaon Home Husband Missing Police Goa Jail Readied For Foreign Nationals

sporadic zoonotic infections posing a potential risk to human health The first evidence of zoonotic transmission of human H1N1 to pigs came from the analytic workup of the Spanish flu in 1918 However no further humanpig H1N1 infection was subsequently demonstrated in Europe until 2009 The pandemic H1N1 virus first occurred in a herd of pigs in Canada in 2009 and after that spread worldwide in human and swine It triggered the seasonal H1N1 virus in humans and is therefore included in human flu vaccines In autumn 2011 cases of a zoonotic infection with the porcine H3N2 virus H3N2v were observed in North America A total of 426 cases were reported in the USA until 2017        The risk of contracting infection by eating pork containing porcine IAV is negligible Swine IAV is confined to the animals respiratory tract the virus has not been detected in muscle tissue even in the course of an influenza infection    Other measures   Besides the pathogens involved in PRDC other factors that affect animals health status are housing conditions pig house climate environmental influences and herd management In a study presented recently Fablet et al in France showed that the likelihood of detecting antibodies to swine IAV in animals increased if more than two groups of animals were present in the vicinity Other influences identified were stocking density in the weaning and fattening house temperature during farrowing a short suckling period and the absence of strict allin allout management  Fablet et al 2013         Besides optimising these additional factors it is important to restrict access to herds   Information about economic losses can be found here          Contact  Imprint  Limitation of liability  Privacy    IDT Biologika GmbH Am Pharmapark 06861 DessauRosslau
