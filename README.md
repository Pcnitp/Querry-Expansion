# Query-Expansion Minor Project
# NITP CSE 6th sem

In general, query of a user is too short and contains some mistakes. Query expansion is a process of reform these queries for improving the efficiency of textual information retrieval system. In this process, on similarity basis we can add, remove or edit any word in the given query so that we can obtain best search result.

#step 1:
fire a query on google and read content of top to pages.
save the content to a file named paragraph.txt
read a line at a time from paragraph.txt and assign its tag using pos-tagger
save each tagged line to another text file paragraph_tagged.txt
